Essentially I‚Äôve started multiple businesses in my life, and some of them are small and some of them have gone on to be a little bit bigger. Every time setting up a business is painful with multiple steps and multiple filings needed.  Additionally, every year, depending on which state you do business and you have to file in that state.  Yes there‚Äôs gusto and there‚Äôs other companies like Zen business and LegalZoom but they are expensive and also still not straight forward.\n\nWhat I would like is to use AI to do all the filing for me and set all this up with a bank account and take care of any compliances in the backend and do it for a lower cost than all these other companies that charge a premium for sometimes free services.  Additionally, if anything happens to the business and needs to be shut it down it will also help with that process because 90% of all startups fail.\n\nThoughts on this I know there‚Äôs a few startups trying to go after this market .",

    "title": "Postmortem for TikTok trends startup idea (i will not promote)",
    "body": "Hey all, want to share my experience trying (and failing) to launch a startup couple years' back. Not promoting anything, just want to talk about it - maybe for self-therapy, maybe to discover something else I could've done. And hopefully someone learns something from this too.\n\n**Background**\n\nCouple years‚Äô back, TikTok was all the rage in the UK. It was¬†growing massively, and people were saying it would take over the Internet. Facebook, Instagram? Obsolete. Google, YouTube? Why bother spending 20 minutes looking for an answer when you can get it in 20 seconds?!\n\nI wanted to capitalize on that momentum.\n\n**The plan**\n\nI decided to build a service that surfaces emerging trends on TikTok. I figured it‚Äôs something that would be popular with a range of audiences - social media managers, influencers, news journalists.\n\nSaw a few people asking about this kind of intel, too. And I spotted a large enterprise in this space. Evidence that people are paying for this type of product.\n\n**Building**\n\nTikTok had a web page where it showed the most popular hashtags over the past week. I set up a daily Python cron job to fetch that data, for the US and the UK, and perform some analysis to predict which of them will keep surging.\n\nI decided to go with a less conventional framework for my web app: Astro in server-side rendering mode. I loved using the framework for my statically-built blog sites, and I wanted to see how its SSR capabilities fared. It worked like a charm.\n\n**Validation**\n\nI posted about it on my LinkedIn account. A friend asked me to extend data coverage to Pakistan, he was thinking of using it for his father‚Äôs (political influencer) social media accounts. I obliged, it was a tiny change; but it didn‚Äôt lead to anything. Another person wanted to join as a business cofounder - I told him to find a few customers to help validate this idea, he never did.\n\nI reached out to social media agency owners. Response rate was poor, but I did manage to have brief exchanges with a couple of individuals. My tool didn‚Äôt seem to catch their interest.\n\nOne owner did ask me about another kind of tool - one that bulk messaged TikTok influencers about affiliate partnerships. I thought there‚Äôs potential, but it would‚Äôve required a big pivot, and an even bigger investment to deliver a prototype. So I passed on it.\n\nI reached out to news journalists, too. I figured that maybe this data would help them uncover stories that people want to read about. Conversations were started, but they ended shortly afterwards.\n\nLastly, I targeted influencers by posting on Reddit.\n\nThey were very well-received. But I stopped after a month, as I realised that this isn‚Äôt a good strategy to grow your TikTok profile. You can‚Äôt be chasing every trend, you need to have a consistent theme.\n\nThere was one final angle I thought about exploring - social media monitoring for companies worried about reputational damage. However, I realised how hard it would be to build something that integrates with TikTok, and I didn‚Äôt know anyone in that space.\n\nAnd so, after a couple of months, I gave up.\n\n**Learnings**\n\nI think the biggest mistake was that I went into a domain that I was totally clueless about. I didn‚Äôt even have the app installed on my phone before!\n\nBut, I don‚Äôt regret it...that much. I was pretty efficient with my time investment, I learned a lot about TikTok, and tried out Astro in SSR mode.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! I hope this is relevant enough for the sub. If not, maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I have an idea and a plan for a start up, in a sense. This would be a non-profit start up. Part of the idea is that there will be a membership structure similar to a fraternal organization, like an Elks Lodge, or a social club. I'm having trouble figuring out the logistics of membership tracking and membership cards.\n\nIdeally I'd like to have a form online a user can fill out, which will create entries in a database. Then use that database to either order or print membership cards to send them. Online applications for local \"chapters\" also need evaluated to see if one already exists nearby. This seems like something that could be automated all the way up to formatting an export file for membership card printing.\n\nIt also sounds like something that I am severely out of my depth on. I'm hoping there might be an out of the box solution that I've been unable to find? So far all the software I've been able to find appears to be for something much more centralized, like gyms, and I'm worried about something like that scaling.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for something that may help? Any ideas for a different way to tackle membership? Or is this likely to be something that must be custom built? I appreciate any help I can get! I will not promote.",

    "body": "It‚Äôs tough to admit, but I poured 4 months into an AI marketing tool, building features I was sure would go viral, only to crash hard. I‚Äôm a technical founder, and like many, I fell into the trap of assuming I knew what customers wanted without really listening. Here‚Äôs my story and the lessons I learned the hard way.\n\n**The Big Mistake**\n\nI started with an AI Meta ad optimizer, convinced it‚Äôd be a game-changer. I thought brands would love it. Was wrong. We pitched to brands, did calls, even flew out for meetings, but nobody trusted us to touch their ad accounts. Then we built a static ad generator, which got some buzz, but free users just spammed us with random feature requests. I was building in a bubble, assuming I knew the market.\n\n**The Wake-Up Call**\n\nThe turning point was when during a pitch, a brand said, ‚ÄúThis is cool, but we need video ads, not this.‚Äù As every noob founder would - I rattled off our fancy features, but they just shrugged. That‚Äôs when it hit me: I‚Äôd spent months solving problems nobody cared about.\n\n**What Was Really Going On**\n\nI was:\n\n* Reading feedback through my own lens, not the customers‚Äô.\n* Building based on what I thought was cool, not what users needed.\n* Missing the real conversations happening in the market.\n\n**What I Did Differently**\n\nI made three big changes:\n\n1. Listened to actual conversations: Monitored X, TikTok, and forums for what marketers were saying about ads.\n2. Talked to paying users: Stopped chasing free users‚Äô wild ideas and focused on what real customers wanted.\n3. Pivoted based on evidence: Learned video ads, especially UGC-style, were the priority, so we built an AI that analyzes competitor strategies and generates static ads plus lip-sync UGC videos.\n\n**The Results**\n\nAfter pivoting:\n\n* Launched on Product Hunt and made $100 in the first week‚Äîour first real sale.\n* Found our initial UGC videos were too polished, so we trained our model on TikTok hooks to make them raw and viral.\n* A trial user begged for extra credits before their trial ended, confirming we were finally solving a real problem.\n\n**Key Lessons**\n\n* Customers are honest in natural settings (X, TikTok, forums), not just interviews.\n* Feature requests hide deeper problems‚Äîdig for the ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù\n* Build for today‚Äôs pain points, not tomorrow‚Äôs guesses.\n* Ship fast, get feedback, and iterate.\n\n**Tips for Others**\n\nIf you‚Äôre building something:\n\n* Follow your market on X, TikTok, or wherever they hang out.\n* Talk to paying users‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones who matter.\n* Track competitor complaints and feature requests for insights.\n* Build a system to log and prioritize what you learn.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nYour customers are already shouting what they want on X, TikTok, or in competitor reviews - you just have to listen. Stop building what you think they need and start solving their real problems.\n\nP.S. Not mentioning my tool directly as per Reddit rules",

Spend 30 seconds on their profile, mention their new gig, their dog, or a recent post. Example: ‚ÄúHey Sarah, saw you got a puppy, adorable! How‚Äôs it going?‚Äù It‚Äôs human, not salesy.\n\n4.        Reach Out to 100 People a Day: Sounds intense, but it‚Äôs just emails or DMs. Tools like Email Analytics helped me track who I hit up, spot replies, and respond on time, made outreach a breese. First message is scary; second‚Äôs easier. I did 100/day for a week and got replies from old connections.\n\n5.        Warm Them Up: When they reply, say something about them, toss a compliment, then ask a question tied to your service. Example: ‚ÄúWow Sarah, running a business and raising a puppy? Superwoman! How do you stay organized?‚Äù This got my first client asking about my coaching bc they saw the value.\n\n6.        Ask for Referrals, Not Sales: Don‚Äôt pitch like a jackass, ask if they know anyone who needs your service. ‚ÄúKnow anyone struggling with productivity? I‚Äôm helping a few folks for free to build my portfolio.‚Äù This scored me 3 referals in a day.\n\n7.        Offer It for Free: Here‚Äôs the controversial shit: work for free at first, dammit. Offer your service to 5 people for feedback and reviews. I coached 5 peeps for free, got killer testimonials, and figured out how to level up.\n\n8.        Keep Hitting Your List: Circle back to your contacts, ask for more referrals. I snagged 10 more leads because they remembred my free work.\n\n9.        Start Charging (Gradually): With testimonials, offer 80% off to the next 5 clients, then 60%, then full price. My first paying client came from a referal who saw my free work and dropped $500/month.\n\n10.        Stay Human, Keep Providing Value: Check in with your list regularly. Share tips, results, or testimonials. People started messaging me to work together because I wasn‚Äôt pushy.\n\nI went from 0 to 5 paying customers in 6 weeks, now I‚Äôm booked at full price! It‚Äôs been a wild ride. Some say working for free screws your worth. I say it‚Äôs the fastest way to stack experience, testimonials, and referrals when you‚Äôre starting out. What do you think? Is working for free a genius move or a rookie fuck-up? What‚Äôs your biggest struggle getting those first customers?",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm exploring ideas for a new venture and the concept of owning and running a highly automated online clinic, specifically focusing on Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), has caught my attention. The idea is to build a system where patient onboarding, scheduling, prescriptions, and follow-ups are largely streamlined, aiming for a clinic that practically runs itself as much as possible.\n\nI've seen examples of training programs that offer to help with this kind automated business model, like what TRT Launch is offering, but I'm looking for foundational advice and maybe some experiences on where to actually begin with such a venture before I join.\n\nThis seems like it would involve navigating complex areas like:\n\n* Legal and regulatory requirements for online medical practices and prescribing (telemedicine laws, HIPAA, etc.)\n* Setting up the necessary tech stack for automation (EHR/EMR systems, scheduling software, communication platforms)\n* Establishing relationships with prescribing physicians and ensuring medical compliance.\n* Patient acquisition and marketing in a regulated space.\n\nIt feels like a significant undertaking with many moving parts. For anyone experienced in healthcare entrepreneurship or building automated service businesses, what are the absolute first steps you would recommend taking? Are there specific legal hurdles to tackle first, or should the focus be on building the operational framework? Any training programs that helped you when you were starting out?\n\nAny insights or guidance on the initial phase of exploring and potentially launching this kind of automated online clinic would be incredibly valuable.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Do a job on one site, take the output, go do work on another site, and so on, all on its own.\n\nBest of all, it's all no-code! Don't need to hire anyone to set up these drag and drop Agents. It‚Äôs getting so advanced that big companies are replacing interns and contractors with these setups.\n\nMy idea is: Build these AI Agents, and rent them out to companies. I did a lot of research on the topic, even wrote about it elsewhere. A startup, funded by Y Combinator, last week posted an ad that they're looking for three AI Agents, and they budgeted a round 1 million dollars for the new employees. Clearly, there's money to be made, with companies being so desperate to jump on the AI bandwagon. There's a Polish job board just for AI Agents already, list yours, and companies rent it, great passive income.\n\nIf you're looking for a lean way to add automation to your biz, an agent is the way to go.\n\nI'm now onto finding out more on how to use agentic AI on Web 3.0.

    "title": "Advice to anyone asking \"What business should I start?\"",
    "body": "This year, I've seen seemingly hundreds of posts across subreddits asking \"What business should I start?\", or \"What is the best business to start?\", or \"I need to make money, how???\"\n\nBack in 2023, I was plagued with the same question. I was tired of my lawn care business. Sure it made money, but not MONEY. It felt like I was just on the hamster wheel. I asked Facebook, friends, family, and google \"What business should I start?\", nothing interested me. Then, I took a quick trip to Austin, Texas.   \n  \nWhile I was there, I found a business that renovated and organized garages. I looked at their pricing on their site, and did some quick numbers, and it seemed like a very profitable business that was different and cool. I thought \"This is IT.\"  \n  \nI went back to my town in Oklahoma, and immediately made a Facebook page, and ran an ad for it. After a couple days of running ads, I looked at how much I was paying per lead and it was $8 for customers willing to pay anywhere from $500-$1500 to get their garage organized. I was so hyped and told everyone that this was my next business. My friends and family all said the same: \"Garage organization? Sounds interesting but I've never heard of anyone doing it. It probably won't work out like you think.\" After about 10 or so variations of that same comment, I got discouraged, and scrapped the idea. Now looking back on it, the idea probably would've worked. And I hate myself for not continuing it.   \n  \nUnfortunately, I don't have a kick ass story telling you \"I made millions.\" I failed because I valued others opinions over my own.\n\nHere is the truth: NO ONE CAN TELL YOU what WILL or WON'T work. Why? Because they aren't you. They don't know your market. They don't know what goals you have. More times than not, they give just bad advice and speak in absolutes.\n\nIf you want to start a business, and have no idea what to start, I'd say just make a list of businesses that interest you, and just start talking to people asking if they need/want this thing and if they will give you money to do it for them. Literally go down the list of businesses and ask friends and family, post on Facebook, list it on Craigslist, run an ad, cold call, and whatever it takes to get someone to give you money. Whenever you get the first dollar from that new idea, that's proof it makes money and that it will \"work\".  \n\nIf you need an idea for a business, use AI, look on reddit, ask people what they need, or just do something you find cool (like garage organization with me).\n\nPeople paying you money is the only thing that matters when you have a new business idea. Ignore the haters and your own insecurities, just make it happen. ",

But here‚Äôs the thing no one really talks about: finding good deals sucks.\n\nI‚Äôd be combing through Redfin at 2am after work, running rehab numbers, pulling rental comps, calculating ROI‚Ä¶ only to realize most of the deals didn‚Äôt even pencil out. It became this time-sucking loop: analyze, run numbers, pass. Repeat. Over and over.\n\nSo I started putting together this little weekly doc for myself‚Äîjust the top 3‚Äì5 deals I thought were worth it, with basic numbers already broken down. Super simple. No fluff. It saved me time.\n\nI sent it to a couple buddies who invest too. They liked it. Then they shared it. Then more people asked. And now, somehow, I‚Äôm sending out a real estate investing newsletter every week to 1000+ people.\n\nIt‚Äôs called *Dealsletter*. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be anything serious. But the process of building it has taught me a lot about real pain points in the space, and honestly, it‚Äôs also made me realize how starved people are for clarity in this industry.\n\nNow I‚Äôm slowly working on turning it into an actual platform. But no big pitch here. I‚Äôm still figuring it out like everyone else.\n\nA couple things I‚Äôve learned along the way:\n\n* People don‚Äôt want another lead-gen tool‚Äîthey want clean, transparent, investor-first data.\n* Building in public (especially through Reddit and Twitter) brings better feedback than any polished landing page.\n* Staying consistent with something weekly is harder than building the tech. No joke.\n\nIf anyone else is building something simple and just trying to validate it, I‚Äôd love to hear how you‚Äôre going about it. Or if you‚Äôre doing content-first before launching a product.

    "body": "The journey started way back in February. There was a launch, some users, 0 revenue and lots of people willing to \"Try us out\". We were solving a problem for the wrong audience and building a wrong product altogether.\n\nThen there was a wedding, a break of a month and back to almost 0 traction.\n\nCut to April, we started reaching out to a segment of our old users and talking to them. Offering them help in return. We started noticing how they were working, what frustrated them, what their goals were.\n\nLittle bit of context may be important: We are building a platform that allows anyone who is borderline technical to **build and manage their mobile apps using AI**. The kind of apps people are building are more business oriented that will be used by either direct users or a marketplace model that will consumed by multiple segments. But 0 hobby apps. Over 95% of our user base in non-technical and generally have a mobile app idea in mind.\n\n**Here's what changed everything for us:**\n\nWe stopped trying to be everything for everyone: Our initial product tried to support every use case imaginable. When we narrowed down to focus specifically on business apps for non-technical founders, our messaging became clearer and our product decisions became easier.\n\nWe built a guided experience: Most of our users had never built an app before. They didn't know what they didn't know. We created a step-by-step process that asked the right questions and guided them through decisions they didn't even realize they needed to make.\n\nWe made error fixing free: This was a game-changer. We noticed users would get stuck when they hit errors, afraid to waste credits trying to fix them. By making error fixing free, usage skyrocketed. People weren't afraid to experiment anymore.\n\nWe simplified our pricing: Started at $15/month for basic apps, with tiers at $60, $99, and $199 for more complex needs. The entry point was low enough that people could justify it as \"cheaper than dinner\" but still provided real value.\n\nWe focused on business outcomes, not features Instead of talking about our AI capabilities, we started focusing on what users could actually do with their finished apps - reach customers, process orders, manage inventory, etc.\n\nThe results were immediate. Within 14 days:\n\n* $30K ARR\n* 40% users on $60+/month plans\n* 68 minutes average session time\n* 100% WoW growth\n* 95% of users are non-technical users\n* First 5 apps built by non-technical users ready for stores\n\nWhat I learned: Non-technical founders don't care about your tech stack or AI capabilities. They care about turning their business idea into reality without learning to code or spending thousands on developers.\n\nThe difference between our February launch (0 revenue) and now ($30K ARR) wasn't a completely different product, it was understanding who our actual users were and what they really needed and how we can make a product that truly resonates with the target audience.",

    "body": "\nA few days ago I posted here about a tool I‚Äôve been building that surfaces startup-worthy ideas hidden in Reddit threads. Things like tool requests, pain points, and unmet needs that often get buried in comments.\n\nThe response totally blew me away. The post got over 60,000 views and more than 100 upvotes. Tons of people joined the waitlist, and I got everything from excited encouragement to tough (but useful) criticism. A few folks pointed out that they‚Äôve seen tools like this come and go - and that most of them didn‚Äôt make it. I hear that, and honestly, it‚Äôs a good reminder to stay focused on what actually helps people.\n\nSince then, we‚Äôve kept building. We cleaned up the waitlist (turns out there were more bots and duplicates than expected) and just started sending out automated emails that include a short survey. We‚Äôre asking people what they‚Äôd expect from the tool, what it should do, and what kind of problems they hope it solves.\n\nThe answers so far are already helping shape the MVP, which we started working on this week. Our goal is to get something simple and useful into people‚Äôs hands quickly, then keep improving it based on what we learn.\n\nWe‚Äôre still figuring out how to keep momentum going without triggering takedowns, how to make the tool stand out, and how to sort signal from noise in all the feedback. But honestly, it feels good to be moving.\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever built an MVP, launched something early, or just enjoy seeing ideas go from mess to product, I‚Äôd love to hear how you approached your first 100 users.\n\nBig thanks again to this community for giving it the initial push. Wouldn‚Äôt be building this without Reddit.\n",

Things like tool requests, frustrating UX, or unmet needs - stuff people talk about all the time, but that‚Äôs buried in replies.\n\nThe response completely surprised me. That post got over 45,000 views, and dozens of people joined the waitlist within hours. Some loved the concept, others weren‚Äôt sure what to make of it.

That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve heard a lot and I totally get it - building something that stands out is tough. But what really stuck with me was a message I got from someone who said: ‚ÄúI scroll Reddit looking for ideas like this every night before bed. If your tool saves me an hour, I‚Äôm in.‚Äù That gave me a bit of fuel to keep going, especially after reading a few ‚Äúthis will never work‚Äù comments.\n\nSince then, we‚Äôve made real progress.\nWe cleaned up the waitlist (a surprising number of bots), set up automated emails, and launched a short survey to understand what people actually expect from a tool like this.

This helps with things like checking feasibility, analyzing market opportunities, brainstorming features, identifying competitors, or even generating professional descriptions. You can also create your own configurable quick prompts.\n* **Organize & Plan:** It includes integrated task management (with sub-tasks and priorities), a file & folder system for each idea, and Kanban boards to visualize progress for both your overall ideas and the specific tasks within them. (Kanban columns are configurable for Pro users).\n* **Tiered Access:** There's a free tier to get started and explore, and a Pro tier for more advanced features and higher limits.\n\n**I'd love your feedback on:**\n\nI'm really open to any and all thoughts, but if you're looking for specifics, I'm particularly curious about:\n\n* Your **first impressions** of the landing page ([https://startidea.dev](https://startidea.dev)) and the overall concept.\n* The **onboarding experience** ‚Äì was it clear and easy to get started?\n* How **intuitive** are the features?

Would love your feedback.\n\nI‚Äôve always felt like file organization on macOS is broken. You try to stay organized, maybe automate things with a script or two, but it always slips (and the mess just comes back).\n\nSo I started building a macOS app called¬†Sparkle¬†‚Äî it watches folders like Desktop and Downloads and organizes files automatically, in the background, based on their names and extensions. It works out of the box and stays out of your way.\n\nWhat it does:\n\nOrganizes folders like Desktop, Downloads, Google Drive, etc. in the background\n\nUses file names and extensions to organize ‚Äî never reads what‚Äôs inside\n\nKeeps a log of every move, so you can see where everything went\n\nLets you revert anything with one click\n\nIt‚Äôs already organized over¬†15 million files, which is kind of wild to type out.\n\nAround this time last year, I left a comfy job at a YC startup with one promise to myself: I‚Äôd only work on products I actually use every day. I care a lot about the organization problem. Not in some productivity guru way, but because when my setup is clean, I actually get stuff done. Clutter kills momentum. Sparkle is my way of making that order happen automatically.\n\nWhat I‚Äôm working on next: Custom prompts, local models for private organization, and making the whole experience feel effortless and adaptable.\n\nYou can¬†try it free for 15 days¬†here:¬†[https://makeitsparkle.co/](https://makeitsparkle.co/)\n\nOn privacy: Sparkle never reads, uploads, or shares your files ‚Äî it organizes using file names only. File name data is deleted every 30 days, and your files always stay on your device.\n\nWould love feedback, bug reports, suggestions, ideas -- I‚Äôm still shaping the roadmap.",

You can also plug in features like prioritizing negative sentiment tickets or routing specific topics to the right team automatically.

    "body": "Hello hackers! Happy Tuesday.\n\nFirst, a little background. I've had this idea for a while now. I worked as a community manager when I was younger, and I noticed that most small and medium companies struggle with the fact that, in the new reality, being online is mandatory. Creating content is a must in order to stay relevant to your niche and your customers.\n\nThat's why I started working on this project: a way to allow entrepreneurs to focus on what they love and leave content creation on autopilot. It took me four months to have something ready, and exactly two days before I had my launch planned, OpenAI came and released their biggest image model yet, easier to use than training an image model yourself, with amazing results and incredible text rendering.\n\nSo after that, I took a week to rethink: should I accept OpenAI‚Äôs impact on my startup, or should I use it to my advantage?\n\nIn the end, I decided to restructure my startup to use that model instead and merge it with my existing functionalities.\n\nAnd that's how BERN-AI was born‚Äîa content creation companion that learns from your company‚Äôs identity and product style to generate highly engaging content and deliver it straight to your email.\n\nYou create a company, add products to it, and that's it! You can choose from different content formats and use cases: either let it gather a content idea from your niche, use a custom prompt for specific needs, or even use saved ideas that you obtained from the idea generator.\n\nAnd the biggest feature is that you can schedule your content for the entire month in one single day. You just schedule it, choose a day and an hour, and relax. Your content will be arriving in your email without the need to come back to the platform. This way, you can focus on what you really love‚Äîselling.\n\nI would love to hear some of your suggestions and advice. Right now, I have four clients already, so I want to improve it as fast as possible to deliver a great product for everyone. \n\n\n\n",

I‚Äôm using Otter.ai for transcription and Descript for editing, and honestly, even if you‚Äôve never used them before, you can get set up in under 2 hours.\n\nThe process kicks off with Otter.ai automatically transcribing webinars. It plugs right into Zoom if you enable cloud recording. For other platforms like Teams or Google Meet, I just share audio with Otter and it works fine. Once the transcript‚Äôs ready, I clean it a bit, then send it to Descript.\n\nDescript is where the fun stuff happens‚ÄîI can highlight key parts, split the content into neat chunks using their Scenes tool, and even create short clips or summaries to share. Super helpful if you want to repurpose stuff for social or blog content.\n\nTo streamline it even more, I used Zapier to set up a flow: after every Zoom recording, it kicks off transcription in Otter, moves the transcript to Descript, and preps it for editing. You can push final output to your CMS, make audiograms, and tweak for SEO while you're editing.\n\nIf you‚Äôre running webinars regularly, this basically unlocks a ton of content you‚Äôre probably just letting sit there.",

The approach uniquely combines LLM-guided code generation with automated evaluation to explore the vast algorithmic design space, yielding mathematically provable improvements with significant implications for computational efficiency.\n* **Mathematical Discovery Engine:**¬†Mathematical discovery becomes systematized through AlphaEvolve's application across dozens of open problems, yielding improvements on approximately 20% of challenges attempted. The system's success spans diverse branches of mathematics, creating better bounds for autocorrelation inequalities, refining uncertainty principles, improving the Erd≈ës minimum overlap problem, and enhancing sphere packing arrangements in high-dimensional spaces.\n* **Data Center Optimization:**¬†Google's data center resource utilization gains measurable improvements through AlphaEvolve's development of a scheduling heuristic that recovers 0.7% of fleet-wide compute resources. The deployed solution stands out not only for performance but also for interpretability and debuggability‚Äîfactors that led engineers to choose AlphaEvolve over less transparent deep reinforcement learning approaches for mission-critical infrastructure.\n* **AI Model Training Acceleration:**¬†Training large models like Gemini becomes more efficient through AlphaEvolve's automated optimization of tiling strategies for matrix multiplication kernels, reducing overall training time by approximately 1%. The automation represents a dramatic acceleration of the development cycle, transforming months of specialized engineering effort into days of automated experimentation while simultaneously producing superior results that serve real production workloads.\n* **Hardware-Compiler Co-optimization:**¬†Hardware and compiler stack optimization benefit from AlphaEvolve's ability to directly refine RTL circuit designs and transform compiler-generated intermediate representations. The resulting improvements include simplified arithmetic circuits for TPUs and substantial speedups for transformer attention mechanisms (32% kernel improvement and 15% preprocessing gains), demonstrating how AI-guided evolution can optimize systems across different abstraction levels of the computing stack.",

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm excited to share **Pivotal Token Search (PTS)**, a technique for identifying and targeting critical decision points in language model generations that I've just open-sourced.\n\n# What is PTS and why should you care?\n\nHave you ever noticed that when an LLM solves a problem, there are usually just a few key decision points where it either stays on track or goes completely off the rails? That's what PTS addresses.\n\nInspired by the recent [Phi-4 paper from Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08905v1), PTS identifies \"pivotal tokens\" - specific points in a generation where the next token dramatically shifts the probability of a successful outcome.\n\nTraditional DPO treats all tokens equally, but in reality, a tiny fraction of tokens are responsible for most of the success or failure. By targeting these, we can get more efficient training and better results.\n\n# How it works\n\nPTS uses a binary search algorithm to find tokens that cause significant shifts in solution success probability:\n\n1. We take a model's solution to a problem with a known ground truth\n2. We sample completions from different points in the solution to estimate success probability\n3. We identify where adding a single token causes a large jump in this probability\n4. We then create DPO pairs focused *specifically* on these pivotal decision points\n\nFor example, in a math solution, choosing \"cross-multiplying\" vs \"multiplying both sides\" might dramatically affect the probability of reaching the correct answer, even though both are valid operations.\n\n# What's included in the repo\n\nThe [GitHub repository](https://github.com/codelion/pts) contains:\n\n* Complete implementation of the PTS algorithm\n* Data generation pipelines\n* Examples and usage guides\n* Evaluation tools\n\nAdditionally, we've released:\n\n* [Pre-generated datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=pts) for multiple domains\n* [Pre-trained models](https://huggingface.co/models?other=pts) fine-tuned with PTS-generated preference pairs\n\n# Links\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/codelion/pts](https://github.com/codelion/pts)\n* Datasets: [https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=pts](https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=pts)\n* Models: [https://huggingface.co/models?other=pts](https://huggingface.co/models?other=pts)\n\nI'd love to hear about your experiences if you try it out!

AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous\npipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using\nan evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve\niteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We\ndemonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational\nstacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found\na functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered\nnovel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems\nin mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery\nmethods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a\nprocedure to multiply two 4 √ó 4 complex-valued matrices using 48 scalar multiplications; offering the\nfirst improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen‚Äôs algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and\ncoding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas\nof science and computation.",

Educate, guide, and share real value.\n\nExample:  \nIf your SaaS helps course creators find TikTok influencers, post something like:\n\n5 Steps to Find TikTok Influencers to Promote Your Course\n\n1.

The best use cases share three traits:\n\n1. **Repetitive tasks that happen multiple times a day**\n   * AI thrives in workflows where one action happens over and over.\n2. **Tasks where delays cost you revenue**\n   * If leads go cold or customers churn because of slow follow ups, AI should step in.\n3. **Processes that follow clear ‚Äúif-this-then-that‚Äù rules**\n   * Refund processing, lead scoring, appointment scheduling ‚Äî AI agents work best when decisions are structured.\n\nIn other words, if a process is high-frequency, time-sensitive, and rule-based, it‚Äôs a strong use case for an AI agent.\n\n**Pro tip:** The best way to find good use cases is to map your entire customer journey on something like Miro or Figma.\n\n# The 4-phase AI agent deployment plan\n\nAI doesn‚Äôt fix broken processes; it automates what already works. So, roll it out strategically.\n\n# Phase 1: Pilot one high-impact workflow\n\n* Pick one revenue-critical or cost-heavy task. Examples are customer support and lead qualification.\n* Deploy an AI agent for that function *only*. This is the pilot.\n* Integrate AI with existing systems like your CRM or helpdesk.\n* Set up KPIs and analytics related to time saved, error reduction, and speed improvements.\n\n# Phase 2: Train AI like an employee, not a bot\n\nTraining AI resembles onboarding a new employee. The more knowledge, structure, rules, and context you provide, the more effective it will be. Here‚Äôs how to do it:\n\n1. **Give it real examples so it learns from past conversations and decisions.**\n\n* **Where to find them**: Chat logs, email transcripts, support tickets, and sales call recordings.\n* **How to upload them:** Most AI platforms let you import CSV files, connect to a CRM, or link knowledge bases like Zendesk, Intercom, or Notion.\n* **Pro tip:** Always start small ‚Äî upload 50‚Äì100 interactions covering common customer questions before expanding.\n\n1. **Define AI‚Äôs job scope**\n\nDecide which tasks AI should handle entirely on its own vs. when it should simply assist. A simple rule of thumb: If a task is repetitive, rule-based, and low-risk, AI can take full control. For anything requiring judgment, creativity, or high-stakes decisions, it should assist or stay out of it.\n\n* **AI only:** FAQs, scheduling, lead qualification, order tracking.\n* **AI + human**: Drafting replies, basic troubleshooting.\n* **Human only**: Complex negotiations, high-stake customer issues, strategic decision-making.\n\n1. **Set escalation rules ‚Äî when should AI hand off to a human?**\n\nDefine clear handoff points:\n\n* **Transfer immediately** if a user asks for a human\n* **Trigger human intervention** if AI detects confusion or frustration\n* **Route to a team other than the support team** if it‚Äôs a sensitive issue (e.g. legal, VIP, etc.)\n\n1. **Set guardrails**\n\nPrevent AI from overstepping in its role with very clear do's and don'ts:\n\n* **Allowed**: Answering pricing questions, suggesting solutions, booking meetings.\n* **Not allowed**: Offering discounts, making refunds above a set amount, closing deals without human review.\n* **How to enforce:** Use AI moderation tools - like Guardrails AI or Content Moderation APIs - that can flag or block unauthorized responses before they go live.\n\n# Phase 3: Measure AI ROI\n\nAI must deliver measurable business value. Here‚Äôs how to track its impact:\n\n1. **Time saved per task:** Compare before/after worklogs\n   * Measure how long tasks take before AI vs. after AI. Use time-tracking tools (e.g. Toggl, Clockify, etc.) or internal reports.\n2. **Cost savings:** Compare payroll vs. automation costs\n   * Track how many hours of work AI replaces per month.\n   * Multiply by the average hourly wage of an employee doing the same task.\n   * Compare it to your AI costs ‚Äî if AI is cheaper and faster, it‚Äôs ROI-positive.\n3. **Revenue impact:** Measure lead conversion and retention rates\n   * Track how fast AI follows up with leads vs. human teams.\n   * Compare conversion rates and churn rates before and after AI agent deployment.\n\nIf AI isn‚Äôt saving time, cutting costs, or increasing revenue, retrain it, tweak workflows, or rethink its roles.\n\n# Phase 4: Scale AI across your business\n\nOnce an AI agent works in one area, expand your AI to other areas where you expect the biggest returns. AI tends to be most valuable in support, sales, operations, marketing, HR, recruiting, and so on. Again, look for repetitive, process-driven flows, and where speed matters.\n\n* **Support:** AI agents can handle [70-80%](https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/press-releases/zendesk-2025-cx-trends-report-human-centric-ai-drives-loyalty/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of tickets (FAQs, refunds, routing).\n* **Sales:** AI agents can qualify leads, book meetings, and follow up ‚Äî so reps spend time closing, not chasing.\n* **Operations:** AI agents can automate scheduling, data entry, and internal workflows ‚Äî keeping teams focused on execution.\n* **Marketing**: AI agents can customize ads, send emails, and reach customers better.\n\nThe key to scaling AI agents is to start where they have the biggest impact, track their success, and expand slowly. And remember, AI agents shouldn‚Äôt replace tasks that require strategy, creativity, or human relationships.",

    "title": "Here‚Äôs what actually got people to start using my SaaS",
    "body": "I kept seeing people talk about how hard it is to get early traction, and I relate to that. I spent months building in isolation, refining features, tweaking UI, and putting in work without hearing much back.\n\nEventually I stopped trying to ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù and started treating every week like a test.\n\nHere‚Äôs what worked and what finally led to real users:\n\n**1. Talk to people before you build anything**  \nI used to build first, then hunt for users. Now I just talk to people who have the problem and write down what they say. The goal is to hear the same pain point over and over again before I write a single line of new code.\n\n**2. Focus on one clear outcome**  \nPeople don‚Äôt care about features. They care about results. The moment I rewrote my landing page to focus on ‚Äúdescribe your trading strategy in plain English, see how it would have performed‚Äù ‚Äî people actually started signing up.\n\n**3. Early access with real value**  \nInstead of offering vague beta invites, I offered to help people test their own ideas using the [tool](https://aiquantstudio.com/). Real use case, real benefit. In return I got feedback that improved the product fast.\n\n**4. Ignore growth hacks early on**  \nTwitter threads, Product Hunt, and cold emails didn‚Äôt move the needle until I had a small group of users who loved what I built. Once that happened, those other channels worked better ‚Äî because I had social proof and clarity.\n\n**5. Build WITH users, not for them**  \nI still talk to users every week. If something breaks or doesn‚Äôt make sense, I fix it with them on a call or in chat. I ask what they expected and how they‚Äôd phrase what they were trying to do. Every one of those conversations improves the product.\n\nRight now I‚Äôm running a small beta with early users and refining based on live feedback. Still a long way to go, but it finally feels like I‚Äôm building something people actually want ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not guessing anymore.\n\nHope this helps someone else who‚Äôs in the quiet early stage. If you‚Äôre working on something and want another set of eyes or feedback, feel free to reach out. Happy to trade notes.",

    "body": "On day one, I fucked up.\n\nKeep in mind, I built two SaaS companies and exited both. I was also the Portfolio Director for a $36M fund, helping grow a stack of SaaS companies from the inside out. Growth is what I do. It‚Äôs what I know. So when I started Marvelous, I told myself I was going to build a growth engine for SaaS teams‚Äîexactly the kind of teams I‚Äôve been working with for the last decade.\n\nBut the moment I launched, I pivoted. I told myself that targeting¬†*all*¬†remote teams was a better move. Bigger market, more opportunity, right?\n\n**Wrong.**\n\nProduct-market fit. The one thing I‚Äôve drilled into countless founders. And somehow, I ignored it in my own launch.\n\nThat one decision created all kinds of problems. Instead of staying focused on helping SaaS companies grow, I found myself trying to build a solution for restaurants, real estate teams, financial institutions, car dealerships...you name it. After all, they‚Äôre remote too. But they all work differently. Their meetings, their goals, their problems, they weren‚Äôt the same.\n\nMy product-market fit fell apart. And I couldn‚Äôt even see it. I was chasing growth in the wrong direction and losing sight of the people I actually built this for. My vision for helping SaaS companies scale got buried in noise.\n\nI wasn‚Äôt laser-focused anymore. I didn‚Äôt even know where to dig in, because I was interviewing teams from totally different industries and each one had slightly different ways of working. Sure, I could build a flexible, modular meeting engine for everyone. But I‚Äôm not an expert in everyone‚Äôs business. That‚Äôs not the point.\n\nAnd what about the bigger picture? The newsletter, the community, the webinars, how do I build content that speaks to a dozen industries at once? I can‚Äôt. Case in point: I fucked up.\n\nThe truth? Fuck-ups are fuel. Growth doesn‚Äôt happen in the wins‚Äîit happens when you screw up, stare it down, and get better.\n\nA famous basketball player once said, ‚ÄúBefore you win, you must first learn to fail.‚Äù I‚Äôve always liked that.\n\n**2 quick lessons:**\n\n* Nail your product-market fit. Don‚Äôt sell out just because the market looks bigger.\n* Failure is underrated. Just don‚Äôt fail at the same thing twice.\n\n**One last thing:**\n\nThis post isn‚Äôt just for you. It‚Äôs a letter to myself that I'm going to bookmark. A reminder to start with the basics, stay focused, and trust the plan.",

    "body": "TL;DR: Stop obsessing over SEO rankings and focus on buyer awareness instead. I doubled conversions in 6 weeks after realizing traffic without conversion psychology is worthless. Don't make the same expensive mistake I did.\n\n\n\nThe SEO industry doesn't want you to know this: rankings without buyer awareness are worthless. I wasted thousands before discovering the truth.\n\nFor years, I was addicted to the dopamine rush of watching our site climb up Google's rankings. I'd celebrate every new position gained, thinking we were making progress. Our traffic graphs looked amazing.\n\nYet our bank account told a very different story.\n\nDespite all that expensive traffic, our conversion rates stayed frustratingly low. We ranked well, but those rankings weren't translating into paying customers.\n\nThen a mentor sent me this wake-up call: \"You don't need more SEO. You need to understand buyer awareness.\"\n\nThat single message transformed our approach to content and marketing. Here's what changed:\n\n\n\nStudied conversion copywriting instead of hiring another SEO specialist\n\nMined our support tickets for the exact language and concerns our best buyers had before purchasing\n\nRewrote our website copy based on buyer awareness stages - different pages now speak to different levels of awareness\n\nStarted measuring conversions first, traffic second - shifted focus to what actually matters for growth\n\n\n\nThe results were immediate and dramatic:\n\n\n\nHomepage conversion rate jumped from 1.2% to 2.8% in just six weeks\n\nLead quality improved dramatically as copy spoke directly to actual pain points\n\nSales cycles shortened as prospects connected with our messaging faster\n\nWord-of-mouth referrals increased because content felt personally relevant\n\nSales conversations improved as leads were already using our language\n\nCustomer lifetime value increased as expectations were properly set\n\n\n\nHere's the hard truth I learned: You might think you need more traffic, but what you probably need is better conversion of the traffic you already have.\n\nGood SEO brings visitors. Good copy brings customers.\n\nWhen you understand where your buyers are in their awareness journey, you can meet them there and guide them forward. Start with buyer awareness, not keyword research.\n\nHappy to answer questions or review anyone's copy here. Just reply or DM.",

I wanted to build something that I myself would use on pretty much every website I build, however this is especially good for businesses with product/service offerings where AI can cut through the noise instantly (Automotive, ECommerce, Law Firms, etc), and B2B businesses who'd like to capture traffic and book them into meetings. It is already quite feature-rich in powerful ways:\n\n* Book meetings through Calendly (more soon) right in chat\n* Recommends products (services too) via inventory integration based on customer needs\n* Captures leads and contact info at the perfect moment\n* Trained on your website and business info in one-click (Web Link/PDF/DOC support)\n* Provides AI summaries and hand-offs to sales teams with every relevant conversation\n* Action builder where teams can essentially 'drag-n-drop' to program their assistant to their custom sales flow\n\nAnyways, I'm very proud and excited to launch this, and I'd love for yall to try it out.

    "title": "Flat Broke & Lost 'Til This Trick Bagged Me My First 5 Clients in Weeks",
    "body": "Ever feel like you're just shouting into a black hole trying to snag your first goddamn clients? Yeah, that was me: zilch customers, empty pockets, and a business idea that felt more like a fantasy. Then I stumbled onto a method that totally changed the game and got me 5 paying customers, like, super quick:\n\n1.        Mine Your Network: Seriously, go through your email, your phone contacts, and all your social media (Insta, LinkedIn, you name it). Dump every single contact out: buddies, relatives, that one guy you met at some conference. I dug up over 2000 contacts I had no clue existed because I just never bothered to look!\n\n2.        Pick Your Playground: Start where most of your people hang out. For me, it was hitting up Instagram DMs. Concentrate your efforts there so you don't get overwhelmed.\n\n3.        Make it Personal, Man: Don't just spam generic bullshit. Take 30 seconds, check out their profile, mention their new job, their pet, or something they recently posted. Like: \"Yo Mark, saw the new puppy, super cute! How's life?\" It feels real, not like you're trying to sell 'em something.\n\n4.        Hit Up 100 Folks a Day: Sounds like a lot, I know, but it's just firing off emails or DMs. Tools (yeah, like that Email Analytics thing) helped me keep track of who I‚Äôd messaged, see who replied, and get back to them promptly, which made the whole outreach thing way smoother. That first message is terrifying; the next one‚Äôs a bit easier. I stuck to 100 a day for a week and actually got responses from people I hadn't spoken to in ages.\n\n5.        Get 'Em Warmed Up: When they hit you back, say something cool about them, give a compliment, then slip in a question related to what you offer. Example: \"Damn Sarah, running a biz and raising a puppy? You're a rockstar! How do you even keep everything straight?\" That‚Äôs how my first client actually asked about my coaching ‚Äì they saw the value.\n\n6.        Ask for Intros, Not Sales: Don‚Äôt be a pushy douche. Ask if they know anyone who could use your help. \"Hey, know anyone swamped and struggling with being productive? I‚Äôm helping a few people out for free right now to build up my case studies.\" Got me 3 referrals in a single day doing that.\n\n7.        Give it Away (For a Bit): This is where people get antsy: work for free initially, seriously. Offer your service to 5 individuals in exchange for feedback and a testimonial. I coached 5 people for nothing, got amazing reviews, and learned a ton about how to improve.\n\n8.        Keep Working That List: Go back to your contacts again, ask for more referrals. I pulled in another 10 leads just because they remembered the free stuff I did.\n\n9.        Start Charging (But Ease Into It): Once you have those testimonials, offer a big discount to the next 5 clients, say 80% off, then maybe 60% off for the next few, then go full price. My very first paying client was a referral who saw my free work and signed up for $500 a month.\n\n10.        Stay Real, Keep Giving Value: Touch base with your list now and then. Share useful tips, your results, or new testimonials. People started reaching out to me to work together because I wasn‚Äôt always selling.\n\nI went from absolute zero to 5 paying customers in about 6 weeks, and now I‚Äôm booked solid at my full rate! It‚Äôs been a crazy journey. Some will tell you working for free devalues you. I think it's the quickest path to load up on experience, glowing reviews, and referrals when you're just starting from scratch. What's your take? Is offering freebies a smart play or a total beginner blunder? What‚Äôs your biggest headache getting those initial customers?\n\n",

    "body": "I think everyone can agree that automation has already reshaped the economy and will only continue to do so. If you don't believe me, try finding a junior software developer role these days. The current push towards automation will affect many sectors from manufacturing, services, professions, and low-skill work. We are on the cusp of a large cross-section of the economy being out of work long-term. Even 20% of people being in permanent unemployment would be a shock to the system.\n\nIt's been widely accepted by many futurists that in a future of increasing automation, states will or should implement a universal income to support and provide for people who cannot find work. Let's assume that this will happen eventually.\n\nAs we can see, liberal democratic governments rarely act pre-emptively and seem to only act quickly once a crisis has already appeared and taken its toll. If we accept this assumption, it's likely that the political process to enact a universal income will only begin once we have mass unemployment and millions of people struggling to survive with no reliable income. We can see how in the United States in particular, it's almost impossible to pass even basic reforms into law due to the need for 60/100 votes in the Senate to break a filibuster. Even if the mass unemployed form a coherent enough political bloc to agitate for UBI, it would seem to me like an uphill battle against the forces of oligarchic patronage and pure government inertia.\n\nMy question is this:\n\nHow long will this interim period between mass unemployment and UBI take? What will it look like? How will governments react? Are we even guaranteed a UBI? What will change on the other side of this crisis?",

    "title": "Novaterra - Utopian World",
    "body": "Have you ever wondered what the world would be like if the world had no borders, or religions that would fear monger you into believing. Well in this manifesto for a better future I will cover that in three main parts. Part 1 will describe Novaterra itself is geographically, politically, and more. \n\nDedication: To Ren for you I dedicate my life too. \n\nPart 1 ‚Äî Novaterra: A Unified World\n\nA world where humanity and all its kind can coexist together under one society ‚Äî Novaterra is that vision. At first, Novaterra will consist only of former countries that willingly submit their territory for the betterment of humanity. These pioneering nations will coexist peacefully with those who choose not to join. But as Novaterra proves itself ‚Äî as people see that it is not just an idea, but a better way of life ‚Äî the citizens of other nations will begin to pressure their governments to submit their territories too.\n\nEventually, Novaterra will not be a country ‚Äî it will be the world.\n\nNovaterra will be structured with purpose: areas dedicated to farmland, industrial infrastructure, solar and wind energy farms, housing, and ‚Äî just as importantly ‚Äî leisure. Those who contribute earn not just their necessities, but their time to rest, create, and enjoy the world they help uphold.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nA System of Direct Democracy\n\nDecisions in Novaterra are made by the people, for the people. If 25% of the population ‚Äî or 25% of a regional population, if the issue is local ‚Äî agrees that a matter needs to be voted on, then a formal vote begins.\n\nTo pass, the outcome must reach at least a 60/40 consensus. Anything less, such as 59/41, resets the proposal. Both sides then have a period to educate and advocate ‚Äî not to argue, but to present the true consequences of the decision. This ensures clarity, not conflict, drives change.\n\nAny action ‚Äî verbal, digital, or physical ‚Äî that causes harm to those with opposing views results in condemnation and social penalties. Debate must remain civil, rooted in truth, and guided by empathy.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nLeadership: A Duty, Not a Throne\n\nIn Novaterra, leadership is not a throne ‚Äî it is a task. Leaders are not elevated above the people. They are chosen for their wisdom, their empathy, their ability to maintain peace and uphold justice ‚Äî not for charisma or control. Their job is to ensure every person lives with dignity and fairness, and that the balance of society is preserved.\n\nLeadership offers no material privilege. There is no currency, no class, and no elite tier. Leaders earn what every contributing person earns: access to life‚Äôs essentials, provided through effort.\n\nLeadership roles are rotational and term-limited. Transparency is not optional ‚Äî it is foundational. Every decision, every policy, every action must be visible to the public. The leader is not a ruler. They are a steward of the people‚Äôs trust.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nWork Quotas Instead of Wages\n\nThere are no paychecks in Novaterra. Instead, citizens fulfill a work quota, determined by the nature and intensity of their role. A healthcare worker or firefighter may work fewer hours than someone with a less demanding job ‚Äî not because one is more important than the other, but because the system is built around fairness, not uniformity.\n\nWhen you complete your work, you receive a Recognition Certificate ‚Äî not a form of money, but a symbol of your contribution. This certificate grants access to housing, food, healthcare, leisure, and more. It‚Äôs not payment. It‚Äôs acknowledgment. A promise that your effort keeps Novaterra alive ‚Äî and that Novaterra, in return, provides for you.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThe Right to Rest, Play, and Dream\n\nWork is not the only measure of a life. Novaterra recognizes that rest, passion, and creativity are not luxuries ‚Äî they are part of being human.\n\nPeople are encouraged to take time off when needed. To explore passions. To pursue the arts, sports, travel, and knowledge. These aren‚Äôt rewards for the privileged few ‚Äî they are available to everyone who does their part.\n\nBecause in Novaterra, your value isn‚Äôt measured in money ‚Äî it‚Äôs measured in your humanity.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nFrom Earth to the Stars: The Future of Expansion\n\nAs Novaterra thrives, the world will no longer be driven by conquest or capitalism ‚Äî but by unity, compassion, and shared ambition. With no more wars to fund and no borders to divide, global resources can be redirected toward humanity‚Äôs greatest challenges ‚Äî and our most exciting opportunities.\n\nPopulation and Housing\nWith global cooperation, innovation accelerates. We can build underground, ocean-based, and vertical smart housing that sustains growing populations without exhausting Earth‚Äôs resources. Clean, efficient, beautiful homes for everyone ‚Äî not because they‚Äôre profitable, but because they‚Äôre necessary.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Automation\nAs AI advances, labor needs will shrink. But instead of fearing job loss, Novaterra will use automation to free humanity. People will be liberated to pursue higher callings ‚Äî science, exploration, caregiving, community building. Machines will handle the mundane. Humans will handle the meaningful.\n\nBecoming a Multi-Planetary Species\nSpace is no longer a national contest ‚Äî it‚Äôs a collective mission. Terraforming, sustainable colonization, and interplanetary exploration will belong to all of humanity. The stars are not for the few ‚Äî they are for the species.\n\nNovaterra will not stop at Earth‚Äôs edge. It will grow ‚Äî not through force, but through hope.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nEducation: We Give to You, So You Can Give Back\n\nIn Novaterra, education is not a competition. It is a gift ‚Äî given freely, so each person can find their strength and give back in their own unique way.\n\nFrom early childhood, students are nurtured to explore what makes them curious. They are not ranked or tested into obedience. Instead, they are guided ‚Äî to think critically, to create, to care. Education is personalized, interactive, and deeply tied to real life.\n\nNo child is turned away. No adult is denied a second chance. Changing paths is not seen as failure, but as growth. Lifelong learning is encouraged, because to grow is human.\n\nSubjects go beyond traditional disciplines:\n\t‚Ä¢\tScience and technology\n\t‚Ä¢\tArt and philosophy\n\t‚Ä¢\tEnvironmental stewardship\n\t‚Ä¢\tConflict resolution\n\t‚Ä¢\tEthics and emotional intelligence\n\t‚Ä¢\tHistory told through all lenses\n\nBecause when we teach through compassion and purpose, we build a future worth inheriting.\n\nConclusion: The Beginning of Us\n\nNovaterra is not a utopia ‚Äî it is a choice. A decision to rise above the systems that have divided us for centuries. It is not born out of perfection, but out of potential ‚Äî the belief that humanity, when united, can build something greater than itself.\n\nThis is not a world without hardship. It is a world where hardship is not faced alone. Where no one starves while others feast. Where no child is denied the right to learn. Where no soul is forgotten because they were born on the wrong side of an invisible line.\n\nThis is just the beginning. A foundation. A declaration that we will no longer wait for change ‚Äî we will become it. Not with force. Not with pride. But with unity. With clarity. With hope.\n\nNovaterra is not a dream. It is a map. And Part 1 is our first step forward.\n\nLet the world watch.\n\nLet the world follow.\n\nLet the world become one.\n\n(Parts after this will be posted at a later date)",

For example, there was a wave of fascination with UFOs and reality shows.\n\nThe Zeitgeist of the 90s, it seems, likes interplay between reality and fiction, truth and lies. This sentiment transferred itself into the early internet, where you could find discussions about technology and pop culture alongside some guy theorizing about conspiracies.  \nAfter 9/11, conspiracy theories became more prevalent.\n\nOn the other hand, the recent Zeitgeist has changed a lot. The medial public seems to view conspiracy theories, fake news, etc., as a serious threat to our society. These things aren't just a childish waste of time, they actually jeopardize the functioning of our system.\n\nI wonder if this sentiment is about the change again.  \nPerhaps the people of 2035 will just roll their eyes if someone still believes in computer-generated fakes on the internet. It would be like how a person from the '90s would see it as playing with our perception of reality.\n\nWhat do you think? And how will this change our society?",

As employers replace humans with machines, their contributions drop, creating pressure on our system.  \n\n**Should we consider changing the employer side of FICA to be based on US revenue, not payroll?**  This would ensure that every company that sold in the US also paid into Social Security.  Every company benefits from being able to sell to Seniors and every company benefits from the demand stabilization, keeping recessions from becoming depressions.  Every company should pay into the fund.  It would be fairer, lessen the impact of automation, and lower the direct cost of hiring a US worker by several thousand dollars.",

    "body": "\"You think it‚Äôs bad now? Oh, you have no idea. In his talks with Ben Thompson and Dwarkesh Patel, Zuckerberg lays out his vision for our AI future.\n\nI thank him for his candor. I‚Äôm still kind of boggled that he said all of it out loud.\"\n\n\"When asked what he wants to use AI for, Zuckerberg‚Äôs primary answer is advertising, in particular an ‚Äòultimate black box‚Äô where you ask for a business outcome and the AI does what it takes to make that outcome happen.\n\nI leave all the ‚Äòdo not want‚Äô and ‚Äòmisalignment maximalist goal out of what you are literally calling a black box, film at 11 if you need to watch it again‚Äô and ‚Äògeneral dystopian nightmare‚Äô details as an exercise to the reader.\n\nHe anticipates that advertising will then grow from the current 1%-2% of GDP to something more, and Thompson is ‚Äòthere with‚Äô him, ‚Äòeveryone should embrace the black box.‚Äô\n\nHis number two use is ‚Äògrowing engagement on the customer surfaces and recommendations.‚Äô As in, advertising by another name, and using AI in predatory fashion to maximize user engagement and drive addictive behavior.\n\nIn case you were wondering if it stops being this dystopian after that? Oh, hell no.\n\n>Mark Zuckerberg: You can think about our products as there have been two major epochs so far.\n\n>The first was you had your friends and you basically shared with them and you got content from them and now, we‚Äôre in an epoch where we‚Äôve basically layered over this whole zone of creator content.\n\n>So the stuff from your friends and followers and all the people that you follow hasn‚Äôt gone away, but we added on this whole other corpus around all this content that creators have that we are recommending.\n\n>Well, the third epoch is I think that there‚Äôs going to be all this AI-generated content‚Ä¶\n\n>‚Ä¶\n\n>So I think that these feed type services, like these channels where people are getting their content, are going to become more of what people spend their time on, and the better that AI can both help create and recommend the content, I think that that‚Äôs going to be a huge thing. So that‚Äôs kind of the second category.\n\n>‚Ä¶\n\n>The third big AI revenue opportunity is going to be business messaging.\n\n>‚Ä¶\n\n>And the way that I think that‚Äôs going to happen, we see the early glimpses of this because business messaging is actually already a huge thing in countries like Thailand and Vietnam.\n\n>So what will unlock that for the rest of the world? It‚Äôs like, it‚Äôs AI making it so that you can have a low cost of labor version of that everywhere else.\n\nAlso he thinks everyone should have an AI therapist, and that people want more friends so AI can fill in for the missing humans there. Yay.\n\n>PoliMath: I don't really have words for how much I hate this\n\n>But I also don't have a solution for how to combat the genuine isolation and loneliness that people suffer from\n\n>AI friends are, imo, just a drug that lessens the immediate pain but will probably cause far greater suffering\n\n\"Zuckerberg is making a fully general defense of adversarial capitalism and attention predation - if people are choosing to do something, then later we will see why it turned out to be valuable for them and why it adds value to their lives, including virtual therapists and virtual girlfriends.\n\nBut this proves (or implies) far too much as a general argument. It suggests full anarchism and zero consumer protections. It applies to heroin or joining cults or being in abusive relationships or marching off to war and so on. We all know plenty of examples of self-destructive behaviors. Yes, the great classical liberal insight is that mostly you are better off if you let people do what they want, and getting in the way usually backfires.\n\nIf you add AI into the mix, especially AI that moves beyond a ‚Äòmere tool,‚Äô and you consider highly persuasive AIs and algorithms, asserting ‚Äòwhatever the people choose to do must be benefiting them‚Äô is Obvious Nonsense.\n\nI do think virtual therapists have a lot of promise as value adds, if done well. And also great danger to do harm, if done poorly or maliciously.\"\n\n\"Zuckerberg seems to be thinking he‚Äôs running an ordinary dystopian tech company doing ordinary dystopian things (except he thinks they‚Äôre not dystopian, which is why he talks about them so plainly and clearly) while other companies do other ordinary things, and has put all the intelligence explosion related high weirdness totally out of his mind or minimized it to specific use cases, even though he intellectually knows that isn‚Äôt right.\"\n\n\"Dwarkesh points out the danger of technology reward hacking us, and again Zuckerberg just triples down on ‚Äòpeople know what they want.‚Äô People wouldn‚Äôt let there be things constantly competing for their attention, so the future won‚Äôt be like that, he says.\n\nIs this a joke?\"\n\n>\"GFodor.id (being modestly unfair): What he's not saying is those \"friends\" will seem like real people. Your years-long friendship will culminate when they convince you to buy a specific truck. Suddenly, they'll blink out of existence, having delivered a conversion to the company who spent $3.47 to fund their life.\n\n>Soible\\_VR: not your weights, not your friend.\n\nWhy would they then blink out of existence? There‚Äôs still so much more that ‚Äòfriend‚Äô can do to convert sales, and also you want to ensure they stay happy with the truck and give it great reviews and so on, and also you don‚Äôt want the target to realize that was all you wanted, and so on. The true ‚ÄòAI¬†[ad buddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries))‚Äô plays the long game, and is happy to stick around to monetize that bond - or maybe to get you to pay to keep them around, plus some profit margin.\n\nThe good ‚ÄòAI friend‚Äô world is, again, one in which the AI friends are complements, or are only substituting while you can‚Äôt find better alternatives, and actively work to help you get and deepen ‚Äòreal‚Äô friendships. Which is totally something they can do.\n\nThen again, what happens when the AIs really are above human level, and can be as good ‚Äòfriends‚Äô as a person? Is it so impossible to imagine this being fine? Suppose the AI was set up to perfectly imitate a real (remote) person who would actually be a good friend, including reacting as they would to the passage of time and them sometimes reaching out to you, and also that they‚Äôd introduce you to their friends which included other humans, and so on. What exactly is the problem?\n\nAnd if you then give that AI ‚Äòenhancements,‚Äô such as happening to be more interested in whatever you‚Äôre interested in, having better information recall, watching out for you first more than most people would, etc, at what point do you have a problem? We need to be thinking about these questions now.\n\n**Perhaps That Was All a Bit Harsh**\n\nI do get that, in his own way, the man is trying. You wouldn‚Äôt talk about these plans in this way if you realized how the vision would sound to others. I get that he‚Äôs also talking to investors, but he has full control of Meta and isn‚Äôt raising capital,¬†although Thompson thinks that Zuckerberg has need of going on a ‚Äòtrust me‚Äô tour.\n\nIn some ways this is a microcosm of key parts of the alignment problem. I can see the problems Zuckerberg thinks he is solving, the value he thinks or claims he is providing. I can think of versions of these approaches that would indeed be ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô to actual humans, and make their lives better, and which could actually get built.\n\nInstead, on top of the commercial incentives, all the thinking feels alien. The optimization targets are subtly wrong. There is the assumption that the map corresponds to the territory, that people will know what is good for them so any ‚Äòchoices‚Äô you convince them to make must be good for them, no matter how distorted you make the landscape, without worry about addiction to Skinner boxes or myopia or other forms of predation. That the collective social dynamics of adding AI into the mix in these ways won‚Äôt get twisted in ways that make everyone worse off.\n\nAnd of course, there‚Äôs the continuing to model the future world as similar and ignoring the actual implications of the level of machine intelligence we should expect.\n\nI do think there are ways to do AI therapists, AI ‚Äòfriends,‚Äô AI curation of feeds and AI coordination of social worlds, and so on, that contribute to human flourishing, that would be great, and that could totally be done by Meta. I do not expect it to be at all similar to the one Meta actually builds.\"\n\n*Excerpts from Zuckerberg's Dystopian AI by Zvi. Can see the full post in the link in the comments*",

    "title": "AI Will Shift the Global Workforce Toward Data-Driven Oversight Roles",
    "body": "I believe we are heading toward a fundamental shift in the global labor market. From agriculture to aerospace, AI will automate a vast portion of operational tasks, and what remains will be roles centered around monitoring, correcting, and guiding AI systems. In short, most industries will evolve toward data operating jobs in supervising the decisions and outputs of AI. Humans will serve more as guardrails, ethical overseers, quality controllers, and decision arbitrators. We'll act as the final check between AI and the real world.\nMultinational companies will likely restructure their hiring priorities. Instead of seeking specialists for traditional roles, they'll look for people who can evaluate AI performance, audit algorithms, ensure compliance, and rucially injecting human judgment where needed. Think of courtroom decisions, HR issues, or sensitive negotiations where empathy, nuance, and ethics matter.\n\nExamples include:\n\nA lawyer no longer writing legal arguments, but assessing AI-drafted motions for fairness and context.\n\nA farm manager not manually inspecting crops, but supervising AI-generated field reports and making decisions on the edge cases.\n\nA journalist reviewing AI-curated news leads for truth and societal impact.\n",

    "body": "This is just my speculation but it makes sense to me.\n\nIn the old days the effect of technology is that it made it easier to satisfy the first and second levels on Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, primarily because the threats to those needs at the time were mostly just forces of nature instead of other people - hunger was caused by difficulty cultivating/gathering food, solved by advances in agricultural technology. Safety was caused by the elements, natural disasters, predators etc, solved by advances in civil engineering and industrialisation. We have now reached a point where we should have enough technology to feed and shelter everyone on earth, but that hasn‚Äôt happened because there are still the other three levels of needs, and unlike the bottom two levels where cooperation can result in win win, the acquisition of esteem is a zero sum - for you to gain esteem, someone else has to esteem, because it‚Äôs all relatively defined. No one‚Äôs a winner if everyone‚Äôs a winner. Why do you need a Lamborghini when a Honda civic gets you from point A to point B just fine?\n\nThe point I want to make here is that once advances in AI, and later robotics, result in the automation of all present day jobs, there will still be jobs, but the nature of the jobs will change from productivity to ornamental - you exist in the organisation simply for the prestige of someone else above you. Your work activities will, on paper, be about some sort of productivity, but what you really work for is esteem and your place in the hierarchy. Office politics will become everyone‚Äôs primary objective, while still keeping a facade of ‚Äúproductivity is the point‚Äù. The organisation doesn‚Äôt really need you to be productive, it‚Äôs probably more productive without you, but if you‚Äôre the boss, what‚Äôs the point of running a company if:\n\n1. Anyone with some money to afford compute time can run a company on autopilot and make money nowadays\n2. Your friend has 100 real authentic^TM humans below him and you have 3 humans and 97 robots?\n\nIt‚Äôs either that, or sex-work, because robots can‚Äôt beat humans in authenticity.",

NET ,and then to solely work on react js ,after few months then again change it to django and recently in Jan to python AWS lambda because the project I was working in demanded that tech stack to know, I  have no experience in working solely or handled a project independently still I tried my best infact build the website changed /added multiple things sometimes even spending 12hr+ on it in a day ,client always had some negative feedback postive too but most of the time feedback I would get would be negative reason being I had to first lookup into how to do things then I practically implied  it i didnt even knew how to shoot pr etc and their was no one to help even in my own company i couldn't ask anyone for help and It was wfh so face 2 face interaction was out of question still I did my best ,build the project worked on feedbacks ,and all this time I was also suffering through the laptop issue as well my company didn't provided me any laptop or machine I had to work on my own ,sometime or i should say most of the time my laptop would shut down due to overheating or some otudated windows problem during working hours as well, company didn't help in that as well I am working in this company for approximately 2 years for now and still they couldnt even provide me laptop ,now to the problem since I was working in this project for 5 months it's beta version was launched and not it was finally moving forward to fully launching it when client said there management has decided not to continue working with me suggesting that my work was not upto the part ,sad thing is I really gave my best I won't lie I used AI for my help a lot because obviously I was not well versed in technology however ai used to solve problem but how to solve it what way should things be implemented etc was done by me ,now I have already submitted my notice period in this current company and with this client feedback I am having very much negative moral whether I would really be good at this job ever or not ,i don't even know what I want to do in my life what is my dream job I only know I completed btech took job in service based company and this is the only skill I know nothing else even though skills are not that good ,I am just lost..thus this happens often with people like they are thrown out of the project when they have mostly completed it ?

I did not do that personally, our IT guy did, but I came up with the vision etc and I put in a few lines of code myself but will not take credit for what he's done.\n\nI've completed Foundational C# with Microsoft/freeCodeCamp and I'm like halfway through Harvard's free CS50 course.\n\nI'm still quite unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, but I kind of know how it's used and what it's purposes are.\n\nI really feel like I would be happy doing this as a career, but I am now 31 and I don't have a CS degree under my belt, I have a music production degree instead. How hard will it be to change careers to a programming one? I know I like more of the backend, logical problem solving. I'm not a big fan of designing websites using HTML/CSS although I'm somewhat familiar with them and would learn them more thoroughly quite quickly should I need to.\n\nI also have just had my first child last year and don't want to take too much of a paycut, I'm currently earning like 32k a year (this is in the UK) and maybe for the sake of it I'd go down to 28k but starting a programming job for 25k is a bit out of the question for me at the moment I feel, due to family commitments.\n\nCould anyone give me some words of advice please and maybe encouragement lol. I feel like I've been learning for so long and I want the ball to start rolling, as I know working in this field will only speed up my learning.\n\nShould I just start applying for jobs and see if can get anything or listen to their feedback?

    "title": "Programming Paradigms: What We've Learned Not to Do",
    "body": "I want to present a rather untypical view of programming paradigms which I've read about in a book recently. Here is my view, and here is the repo of this article: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/programming-paradigms-explained :-)\n\n# Programming Paradigms: What We've Learned Not to Do\n\nWe have three major paradigms:\n\n1. Structured Programming,\n2. Object-Oriented Programming, and\n3. Functional Programming.\n\nProgramming Paradigms are fundamental ways of structuring code. They tell you what structures to use and, more importantly, **what to avoid**. The paradigms do not create new power but actually limit our power. They impose rules on how to write code.\n\nAlso, there will probably not be a fourth paradigm. Here‚Äôs why.\n\n## Structured Programming\n\nIn the early days of programming, Edsger Dijkstra recognized a fundamental problem: programming is hard, and programmers don't do it very well. Programs would grow in complexity and become a big mess, impossible to manage.\n\nSo he proposed applying the mathematical discipline of proof. This basically means:\n\n1. Start with small units that you can prove to be correct.\n2. Use these units to glue together a bigger unit. Since the small units are proven correct, the bigger unit is correct too (if done right).\n\nSo similar to moduralizing your code, making it DRY (don't repeat yourself). But with \"mathematical proof\".\n\nNow the key part. Dijkstra noticed that certain uses of `goto` statements make this decomposition very difficult. Other uses of `goto`, however, did not. And these latter `goto`s basically just map to structures like `if/then/else` and `do/while`.\n\nSo he proposed to remove the first type of `goto`, the bad type. Or even better: remove `goto` entirely and introduce `if/then/else` and `do/while`. **This is structured programming.**\n\nThat's really all it is. And he was right about `goto` being harmful, so his proposal \"won\" over time. Of course, actual mathematical proofs never became a thing, but his proposal of what we now call structured programming succeeded.\n\n### In Short\n\nMp `goto`, only `if/then/else` and `do/while` = Structured Programming\n\nSo yes, structured programming does not give new power to devs, it removes power.\n\n## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\nOOP is basically just moving the function call stack frame to a heap.\n\nBy this, local variables declared by a function can exist long after the function returned. The function became a constructor for a class, the local variables became instance variables, and the nested functions became methods.\n\nThis is OOP.\n\nNow, OOP is often associated with \"modeling the real world\" or the trio of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, but all of that was possible before. The biggest power of OOP is arguably polymorphism. It allows dependency version, plugin architecture and more. However, OOP did not invent this as we will see in a second.\n\n### Polymorphism in C\n\nAs promised, here an example of how polymorphism was achieved before OOP was a thing. C programmers used techniques like function pointers to achieve similar results. Here a simplified example.\n\nScenario: we want to process different kinds of data packets received over a network. Each packet type requires a specific processing function, but we want a generic way to handle any incoming packet.\n\n```C\n// Define the function pointer type for processing any packet\ntypedef void (_process_func_ptr)(void_ packet_data);\n```\n\n```C\n// Generic header includes a pointer to the specific processor\ntypedef struct {\n    int packet_type;\n    int packet_length;\n    process_func_ptr process; // Pointer to the specific function\n    void* data; // Pointer to the actual packet data\n} GenericPacket;\n```\n\nWhen we receive and identify a specific packet type, say an AuthPacket, we would create a GenericPacket instance and set its process pointer to the address of the process_auth function, and data to point to the actual AuthPacket data:\n\n```C\n// Specific packet data structure\ntypedef struct { ... authentication fields... } AuthPacketData;\n\n// Specific processing function\nvoid process_auth(void* packet_data) {\n    AuthPacketData* auth_data = (AuthPacketData\\*)packet_data;\n    // ... process authentication data ...\n    printf(\"Processing Auth Packet\\n\");\n}\n\n// ... elsewhere, when an auth packet arrives ...\nAuthPacketData specific_auth_data; // Assume this is filled\nGenericPacket incoming_packet;\nincoming_packet.packet_type = AUTH_TYPE;\nincoming_packet.packet_length = sizeof(AuthPacketData);\nincoming_packet.process = process_auth; // Point to the correct function\nincoming_packet.data = &specific_auth_data;\n```\n\nNow, a generic handling loop could simply call the function pointer stored within the GenericPacket:\n\n```C\nvoid handle_incoming(GenericPacket\\* packet) {\n    // Polymorphic call: executes the function pointed to by 'process'\n    packet->process(packet->data);\n}\n\n// ... calling the generic handler ...\nhandle_incoming(&incoming_packet); // This will call process_auth\n```\n\nIf the next packet would be a DataPacket, we'd initialize a GenericPacket with its process pointer set to process_data, and handle_incoming would execute process_data instead, despite the call looking identical (`packet->process(packet->data)`). The behavior changes based on the function pointer assigned, which depends on the type of packet being handled.\n\nThis way of achieving polymorphic behavior is also used for IO device independence and many other things.\n\n### Why OO is still a Benefit?\n\nWhile C for example can achieve polymorphism, it requires careful manual setup and you need to adhere to conventions. It's error-prone.\n\nOOP languages like Java or C# didn't invent polymorphism, but they formalized and automated this pattern. Features like virtual functions, inheritance, and interfaces handle the underlying function pointer management (like vtables) automatically. So all the aforementioned negatives are gone. You even get type safety.\n\n### In Short\n\nOOP did not invent polymorphism (or inheritance or encapsulation). It just created an easy and safe way for us to do it and restricts devs to use that way. So again, devs did not gain new power by OOP. Their power was restricted by OOP.\n\n## Functional Programming (FP)\n\nFP is all about immutability immutability. You can not change the value of a variable. Ever. So state isn't modified; new state is created.\n\nThink about it: What causes most concurrency bugs? Race conditions, deadlocks, concurrent update issues? They all stem from multiple threads trying to change the same piece of data at the same time.\n\nIf data never changes, those problems vanish. And this is what FP is about.\n\n### Is Pure Immutability Practical?\n\nThere are some purely functional languages like Haskell and Lisp, but most languages now are not purely functional. They just incorporate FP ideas, for example:\n\n- Java has final variables and immutable record types,\n- TypeScript: readonly modifiers, strict null checks,\n- Rust: Variables immutable by default (let), requires mut for mutability,\n- Kotlin has val (immutable) vs. var (mutable) and immutable collections by default.\n\n### Architectural Impact\n\nImmutability makes state much easier for the reasons mentioned. Patterns like Event Sourcing, where you store a sequence of events (immutable facts) rather than mutable state, are directly inspired by FP principles.\n\n### In Short\n\nIn FP, you cannot change the value of a variable. Again, the developer is being restricted.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe pattern is clear. Programming paradigms restrict devs:\n\n- **Structured**: Took away `goto`.\n- **OOP**: Took away raw function pointers.\n- **Functional**: Took away unrestricted assignment.\n\nParadigms tell us what not to do. Or differently put, we've learned over the last 50 years that programming freedom can be dangerous. Constraints make us build better systems.\n\nSo back to my original claim that there will be no fourth paradigm. What more than `goto`, function pointers and assigments do you want to take away...? Also, all these paradigms were discovered between 1950 and 1970. So probably we will not see a fourth one.",

    "title": "Cloudflare's New Approach to Bot Verification: Cryptographic Signatures",
    "body": "I just came across an interesting Cloudflare blog post proposing a new way to verify web bots using cryptographic signatures instead of outdated IP-based methods. Here‚Äôs a quick summary of the key points‚Äîthought it might spark some discussion!\n\n**What‚Äôs the Deal?**\n\n* **The Problem**: Traditional bot detection (IP checks, User-Agent strings) is failing. Sophisticated bots mimic human behavior, making it tough to distinguish good bots (e.g., search engine crawlers) from bad ones (e.g., DDoS attackers). IPs are unreliable due to proxies and anonymization.\n* **The Solution**: Cloudflare suggests bots use cryptographic signatures (via public-private key pairs) to prove their identity. This lets website owners verify traffic sources securely without leaning on shaky IP data.\n\n**Cool Stuff Cloudflare‚Äôs Offering**\n\n* They‚Äôve released a **npm package called** web-bot-auth, which helps developers generate signed HTTP requests for bots. It‚Äôs designed to make integrating this verification super straightforward.\n* The signatures are tough to forge, boosting security and ensuring only legit bots get through.\n\n**Why It Matters**\n\n* **Accuracy**: No more accidentally blocking good bots like Google‚Äôs crawler or legit AI agents. Better user experience all around.\n* **Security**: Cryptographic signatures are way harder to spoof than IPs, keeping malicious bots at bay.\n* **Future-Proofing**: With AI agents and automation on the rise, this could become a standard for a safer, more automated web (think ‚Äúagentic web‚Äù).\n\n**Big Picture**\n\nCloudflare‚Äôs pushing for cryptographic signatures to replace clunky old methods, and they‚Äôre even tying it to broader efforts like an IETF draft on mTLS. It‚Äôs a step toward a web where bots can be trusted without jumping through hoops.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? Let‚Äôs hear your thoughts.",

    "body": "I‚Äôve been working on securing my authentication flow for a web application, and I wanted to share some key lessons I‚Äôve learned about managing **Refresh Tokens** securely and effectively. Refresh Tokens are essential for maintaining long-term sessions without requiring users to log in constantly, but if not handled properly, they can pose serious security risks.\n\nHere‚Äôs a breakdown of best practices I‚Äôve found:\n\n1. **Store Refresh Tokens Securely (HttpOnly Cookies)** Instead of localStorage or sessionStorage, it‚Äôs safest to store refresh tokens in **HttpOnly cookies**. This makes them inaccessible to JavaScript and helps prevent XSS attacks.\n2. **Use Short-lived Access Tokens** Keep your access tokens valid for only a short period (e.g., 15 minutes) and rely on refresh tokens to renew them. This limits exposure if an access token is compromised.\n3. **Rotate Refresh Tokens** On every token refresh, issue a new refresh token and invalidate the previous one. This makes it harder for attackers to reuse stolen tokens.\n4. **Implement Token Revocation Mechanism** Store a record of issued refresh tokens (e.g., in a database), and allow users to revoke them (especially useful for logout or compromised sessions).\n5. **Bind Refresh Tokens to User Agents and IPs (optional but recommended)** You can optionally bind tokens to specific user agents or IP addresses to prevent token reuse in different environments.\n6. **Set Expiration and Use Sliding Expiry** Refresh tokens should also expire. Sliding expiration is useful, where each usage slightly extends the lifetime ‚Äî but still with a hard max expiry.\n7. **Secure the Transport (HTTPS)** Always use HTTPS to transport tokens. This is non-negotiable to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nWhat about you? How do you handle refresh tokens in your projects? Would love to hear your thoughts and compare strategies.",

    "title": "Freelancers ‚Äì the only person that can evaluate your pricing is the buyer (not Reddit)",
    "body": "*(TL;DR at bottom)*\n\nQuestions like this pop up on this subreddit every few weeks:\n\n> How much should I charge for a basic website?\n\nOr:\n\n> Is $500 for a single-page Figma design a good price?\n\n...and I'd like to share my experience from a decade and a half of freelancing full-time‚Äìdealing with clients of all shapes and sizes‚Äì to hopefully help others to avoid the problems that materialize when asking stuff like this.\n\n  \n***\n\n**Here's the problem with questions like these:** none of these questions are answerable by anyone other than the person who is receiving (and evaluating) the price.\n\n  \nI've built simple websites for clients for anywhere from the low $X,XXX range, to the high $XX,XXX range.  I know of others who charge well into 6-figures for similar work.\n\nThe difference? The latter clients perceive the impact of their project to be much higher.\n\n**That's it.**\n\nIf you have access to the kinds of people that have valuable problems worth solving, you will do very well for yousrself as a freelancer.  As you'd expect, most people do not have this access, and find themselves constantly fishing in the bottom of the barrel for low-value work.\n\nWhen people want to hire someone for anything, they *always* have some idea in their mind of what's feasible to spend.  That number is determined long before you talk to them (either by some sort of financial impact analysis, or a \"feeling\" in the buyer's mind).  **There is very little you can do to influence this number.**\n\nIt's important to note that this implies that even if you go through some crazy charade of multiplying your rate by some randomg number of hours you think it's going to take, **this won't change how valuable your client perceives the project to be**.\n\nSo ‚Äì all this giant text wall to say: when you are thinking about asking Reddit for pricing guidance, please understand that you are setting yourself up for failure.\n\nInstead, you need to ask the buyer directly what their price expectations are.\n\nPricing conversations that don't include the buyer are fruitless exercises and almost always cause more pain and confusion both parties.  These conversations can be difficult, but they are *waaay* less difficult that just guessing and getting ghosted.\n\nI hope this helps, and if you have a different perspective, would love to hear it.\n\n***\n\n## Some Common Objections (and why they're nonsense)\n\n### **Client says: I genuinely don't have a budget, and have no idea how much I should spend on this**\n\nYou usually hear this from either very novice buyers, or perhaps counterintuitively, from very experienced, manipulative buyers.  \n\nThis sort of objection is a big yellow flag for me.  Why?\n\n1. Even if you don't have a dedicated budget, you know what is feasible for you to spend on this.\n2. If you genuinely have no idea, that means you have done very little feasibility analysis **and you should probably not be hiring anyone in the first place.**\n3. You know fine well what you'd be willing to spend, but you're intentionally not disclosing it because you think a time+materials price will be lower.\n\n### **Client says: I'm just looking for quotes right now**\n\nYour client has a budget, but it is very low.  This is a yellow flag for price sensitivity, and generally speaking you should try to avoid these sorts of clients.\n\nWhen a prospect does say something like this, I like to use the house analogy:\n\n> When buying a house, you wouldn't make your realtor guess about what sorts of homes are affordable to you.  If you can't afford a $10M mansion, you're going to waste lots of people's time and piss people off by touring them.  Custom web projects are the same: we can do projects from $500 to $5M.  The level of involvement is defined by what's feasible to you.  Although you may not have a specific budget, I need some guidance so we don't spend lots of time discussing impractical solutions.\n\n*(Note that this only works for bespoke custom projects, for obvious reasons.)*\n\n### **Anything about \"market value\"**\n\nCustom projects are not commodities, and as such are not subject to the same economic forces of supply and demand.  Every single project is unique, if only because there is a different *buyer* each time.\n\nIf you are thinking about your services like this, then you are going to be constantly fighting the race to the bottom, and good luck to you.\n\nIf your client thinks this way, just refer them to UpWork and save yourself the hassle.\n\n### **We're just a startup, we're cash poor right now**\n\nThis person still has a budget, but it is again low because value is uncertain pre-revenue.  I usually tell these people that if they can't afford good design services, they should just use some sort of drag-and-drop builder by themselves until they can.\n\nEarly-stage founders should be weary of burning cash on bespoke projects before their idea itself is validated.  **MOST of the projects that freelancers field are not valuable enough to justify a baseline cost.**\n\n### **I don't want to share my budget, because I'm worried that price will magically equal that number**\n\nThis is a reasonable concern ‚Äì and as consultants we need to do better at handling the budget conversation with tact so this sentiment lessens.\n\nThe reality is however: you will spend as much as you want to, **no matter whether you share your budget.**\n\nIf you force a provider to guess, and they come in too low, you'll think they're doing cheap work.\n\nIf you force them to guess, and it comes in too high, you'll probably ghost them.\n\nSo, instead, sensible providers will give you several options that increasingly de-risk the project as spending goes up, likely capping at your budget.\n\nPut more simply ‚Äì if you've ear-marked $50K to spend on this, and you only spend $30K, you're introducing unnecessary risk to your project.  Bespoke projects like the ones people get in this subreddit are extremely versatile ‚Äì there's *so much* that can be done to help reach the goal.\n\n\n## TL;DR\n\nEvery single person/company that wants to hire an independent worker for a bespoke project, has *some* idea in their mind of what is feasible to them to spend.  Not disclosing this results in negative outcomes for both parties, and is often indicative of a manipulative, or inexperienced buyer.  You can use this information to be more selective with your clients and lead a healthier, more profitable career, and asking people on Reddit instead is only going to cause you more problems.",

    "body": "Hey r/RedditDev and fellow Redditors! üëã\n\nI‚Äôm excited to introduce Reddit-Fetch, a Python-based tool I built to fetch, organize, and back up saved posts and comments from Reddit. If you‚Äôve ever wanted a structured way to store and analyze your saved content, this is for you!\n\nüîπ Key Features:\n\n‚úÖ Fetch & Backup: Automatically downloads saved posts and comments.\n\n‚úÖ Delta Fetching: Only retrieves new saved posts, avoiding duplicates.\n\n‚úÖ Token Refreshing: Handles Reddit API authentication seamlessly.\n\n‚úÖ Headless Mode Support: Works on Raspberry Pi, servers, and cloud environments.\n\n‚úÖ Automated Execution: Can be scheduled via cron jobs or task schedulers.\n\nüîß Setup is simple, and all you need is a Reddit API key! Full installation and usage instructions are available in the GitHub repo:\n\nüîó GitHub Link: [https://github.com/akashpandey/Reddit-Fetch](https://github.com/akashpandey/Reddit-Fetch)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and suggestions! Let me know how you'd like to see this tool evolve. üöÄüî•\n\n  \nUpdate: Added support to export links as bookmark HTML files, now you can easily import the output HTML file to Hoarder and Linkwarden apps.\n\nWe'll make future changes to incorporate API push to Linkwarden(Since Hoarder doesn't have the official API support).\n\nFeel free to use and let me know!",
