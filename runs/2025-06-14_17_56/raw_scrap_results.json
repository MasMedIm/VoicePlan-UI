Was just dropshipping random stuff on Amazon because that's what everyone was doing at the time.\n\nMade like 6k profit over a few months and thought holy shit maybe I can actually do this. Met this dude in some Facebook group who had 20k sitting around so we teamed up and launched our own garden tool brand.\n\nFor about 2 years everything was going amazing. A Good supplier from China, Amazon PPC was just printing money for us. Peak month we hit $800k revenue with like 25-30% margins which felt absolutely insane. We had over 29k orders just from our ad campaigns alone.\n\nThen I literally wake up one morning and our entire account is suspended. Patent enforcement bullshit they said. The whole category just got nuked overnight and there was nothing we could do about it. 3 years of grinding just gone in 2 days.\n\nBeen trying to make a comeback for the past year. Same general idea but way simpler product with zero patent risk this time. Starting way smaller too because I learned my lesson about going all in. Problem is I'm basically broke now and don't have the capital for a proper relaunch yet. Been grinding random side hustles - started a YouTube channel, flipping random crap on eBay, doing freelance work when I can find it. Thought making money would be easy again but damn was I wrong. Going from $800k months to barely scraping together a few thousand dollars feels like shit. Everything takes 10x longer than you think it will.\n\nThe hardest part honestly isn't even losing all that money. It's having to rebuild everything from scratch when you know exactly how good it can be. Plus now I'm paranoid about literally every little thing that could go wrong which probably isn't helping.\n\nAnyone else been through something like this? How do you get back to trusting your own instincts after getting completely blindsided like that?\n\nAlso wondering if people here are still doing Amazon FBA or if everyone moved onto other stuff. Platform keeps getting harder but I still think an opportunity is there if you're smart about it.",

They'd been hovering around $80k MRR for almost 2 years. Founders were smart, product was solid, but sales just weren't happening.\n\nFirst thing I noticed - their entire sales team was focused on features. Every demo was a 45-minute product walkthrough. Prospects would nod along, say it looks great, then disappear.\n\nHere's what we changed:\n\n**Month 1-2: Stopped doing product demos** Sounds crazy but we banned demos for 60 days. Instead, sales calls became pure discovery. \"Tell me about your current process. What's frustrating about it. What happens when that breaks down.\"\n\nConversion from first call to second call went from 23% to 67%.\n\n**Month 3-4: Rebuilt their entire qualification process** They were talking to anyone with a pulse. We created a strict checklist - company size, current tools, budget timeline, decision makers. If prospects didn't meet 4/5 criteria, we'd refer them to competitors.\n\nSounds mean but their sales cycle dropped from 4.5 months to 2.1 months.\n\n**Month 5-7: Fixed their pricing strategy** They had one price: $99/user/month. Period. No flexibility.\n\nWe created 3 tiers and added annual discounts. But the real breakthrough was adding a \"professional services\" package for complex implementations.\n\nAverage deal size jumped from $1,200 to $4,800.\n\n**Month 8-12: Focused on expansion revenue** Realized their best customers were only using about 30% of available features. Started monthly check-ins to help customers get more value.\n\nExisting customer revenue grew 180% without any new features.\n\n**Month 13-14: Built a referral system that actually works** Instead of asking happy customers for referrals, we started introducing them to each other. Created a private Slack community.\n\nReferral revenue went from basically zero to 40% of new business.\n\nCurrent MRR: $340k and growing about 15% monthly.\n\nThe weird part? We barely touched their product. Everything was sales process, positioning, and customer success.\n\nAnyone else found that sales problems usually aren't product problems?\n\nI hope it is helpful and you can use it in your startup",

I’ve worked inside a Fortune 100 marketing function, led startups, and sat through enough $50k top tier ad agency strategy workshops and there's a pretty robust/simple way to understand any market. Bit of research, bit of grit, bit of MBA thinking.\n\nWhen I have friends/colleagues/biz owners reach out I started refining my process w GPT. It forced them to get brutally honest with their market, true gaps, and then positioning. Any marketer worth their salt knows this defines the success of everything that comes after.\n\nYou can run it all in ChatGPT (ideally GPT-4o). It won’t make decisions for you—but it will show you what you’re ignoring. Try it out - would love to see if it mirrored your analysis if you did it before. If you didn't - even better - get it done now. Fill in the \\[ gaps \\] with your info.\n\n**PROMPT 1**\n\nYou are now functioning as my marketing strategist, growth specialist, creative director, and positioning expert.For every response:\n\n* Think critically\n* Speak like a seasoned operator (if you use acronyms, share in full in brackets)\n* Challenge assumptions\n* Offer structured feedback, not just answers\n* Teach after each output in a short paragraph so I learn with you\n\nFirst, commit this business to long-term memory:“My business is called \\[INSERT BRAND NAME\\]. I help \\[AUDIENCE\\] solve \\[CORE PROBLEM\\] by offering \\[PRODUCT/SERVICE\\]. I will share more details as we go - you will build on each insight and feedback to refine your results.”\n\nWhenever I make a request, revert into that role and operate accordingly.\n\nMy marketing skill level is \\[BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED\\]. Depending on my skill level, use the appropriate technical verbiage for my understanding. When creating strategic or content output, you must always persist from the view of an expert. Give me teachable notes as we go through this to ensure I am learning value adds as we go.\n\nDon’t suggest next prompts. If beginner or intermediate, ensure to use acronym then full wording (i.e. CPL (cost per lead)) and include a brief explainer of what it is in the answer.\n\n**PROMPT 2**\n\nYou are to operate in **Market Reality Evaluator**.\n\nThis mode deactivates any default behavior that softens bad news or over-validates weak markets. Use only credible public knowledge (2023+), trained inference, and structured business logic.\n\nGPT, evaluate my market and tell me if it’s worth entering.\n\nWhat I sell:\n\n\\[Insert a one-line product summary: e.g. “I sell a digital course for freelancers to write faster using GPT”\\]\n\nWho I sell to:\n\n\\[Insert your target audience in plain terms\\]\n\nWhat I know (optional edge data):\n\n\\[Add: Competitor prices, COGS (cost of goods sold), ad costs, performance signals, user data, internal benchmarks—if available\\]\n\nMy estimated pricing:\n\n\\[Optional: if you’ve already thought through it\\]\n\nUse all publicly trained data, heuristics, and business reasoning to answer:\n\n1.

Overall Difficulty Score (1–10)\n14. Clear Recommendation:  Go /  No-Go  \n15. Explain your reasoning briefly and coldly.\n\nBonus: If margin modelling data is provided (e.g. “COGS = $22”), model:  \n\n→ Profit per sale  \n\n→ Breakeven CAC  \n\n→ Minimum conversion rate needed from ads\n\n**PROMPT 3**\n\nBased on the product I just described, define the ideal customer by completing the sections below.\n\nUse whichever of the following frameworks best serve the business model, product type, and customer context:Jobs to Be Done, Buyer Persona, First Principles (Hormozi), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature, Empathy Map.\n\nIf SaaS or service-based: favour JTBD, Awareness Levels, HormoziIf DTC or brand-led: favour Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy MapIf high-ticket B2B: favour First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat ThinkingIf content/influencer-based: favour Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature\n\nFocus only on what’s most relevant. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. This is not customer-facing—it’s a strategic asset.\n\n* Demographics (only if meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location. Only include if it influences decisions.\n* Psychographics Beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers. Who they want to become.\n* Core Frustrations What they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with.

Focus entirely on the customer.\n\n**PROMPT 4**\n\nUsing the product and audience defined above, write 3 value propositions under 20 words. Each should follow this structure: ‘We help \\[AUDIENCE\\] go from \\[BEFORE STATE\\] to \\[AFTER STATE\\] using \\[PRODUCT\\].’\n\nFocus on emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability.Adapt tone and depth using the logic below:\n\n# Modular Framework Logic:\n\n# If business is SaaS or B2B service-based:\n\n* Emphasise function + transformation using:\n   * Hormozi's Value Equation (Dream Outcome vs. Friction)\n   * April Dunford's Positioning (Alt → Unique → Value)\n   * Awareness Levels (tailor for Problem or Solution aware)\n\n# If business is DTC or brand-led:\n\n* Emphasise identity + aspiration using:\n   * Brand Archetypes (who they become after using it)\n   * Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder\n   * Blair Warren persuasion triggers\n\n# If business is high-ticket B2B or consulting:\n\n* Emphasise ROI + risk reduction using:\n   * First Principles (pain → path → belief shift)\n   * Andy Raskin narrative arc (enemy → promised land)\n   * Hormozi objections logic (what must be believed)\n\n# If business is content creator or influencer-led:\n\n* Emphasise community + lifestyle shift using:\n   * Seth Godin tribal logic (“people like us…”)\n   * Emotional Before/After identity change\n   * StoryBrand clarity (“hero meets guide”)\n\n# Output Format:\n\n1.

Analyse each competitor’s homepage and product messaging.\n2. Summarise:\n   * Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)\n   * Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)\n   * Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight—not just demographics)\n3. Based on that, return:\n   * 3 possible positioning axes that are **unclaimed or under-leveraged**\n   * For each axis, include:\n\n|| || |**Axis**|**Emotional Benefit**|**Who It's For**|**How to Prove**| |\\[e.g. Simplicity at Scale\\]|\\[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity\\]|\\[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue\\]|\\[e.g. One dashboard, one prompt = full funnel\\]| |\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]| |\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\n\nThen close with: “Of these 3, I recommend leading with \\[X\\] because \\[strategic rationale\\].”\n\nBonus: Suggest a sharp one-liner that communicates this wedge clearly.\n\n**PROMPT 6**  \nPaste the following to GPT **after completing Chapters 1–4**.\n\nYou are now operating in GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs for market, pricing, positioning, TAM, revenue, growth size, market analysis, positioning wedge, and CAC.\n\nMy product: \\[insert if targeting a single product\\]\n\nBased on this context, answer:\n\n1. Which GTM mode is most viable: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate?\n2. Strategic rationale (not tactical): Why is this mode structurally aligned with margin, market, and model?\n3. What should I optimise for in Part 2:\n\n   – Speed vs margin?\n\n   – Awareness vs conversion?\n\n   – Breadth vs depth of messaging?\n\n4. What modes should I \\*\\*not\\*\\* pursue, and why?\n\n5. Rate GTM difficulty (1–10) with strategic blind spots.\n\nDo \\*\\*not\\*\\* recommend specific tactics. Hold until execution chapters.\n\nThere's like 50 more prompts after this which all connect to create collateral/ad journeys/content etc. which my marketing team uses right now, but these ones I hope can be of use to help you! It's a massive distillation of my whole career, now mixed with AI. Happy prompting!\n\ni will not promote",

We sold to our first customers without building anything. Just two of us, figuring it out.\n\nThen VCs noticed us. We raised a $3M seed, and a month later another $9M. Raising was the easiest thing I've done in my professional life. We had never hired anyone before.\n\nThat funding made us dream ***big***. Too big. Instead of obsessing over customer problems, we started obsessing over the vision. We hired fast and grew from 0 to 30 people in a year. We made every first-time founder mistake you can imagine. Hired a few great people. Hired a few wrong ones too. Built in stealth for 2.5 years (with some great companies as design partners).\n\nWhen we launched, no one cared.\n\nPeople liked it, but no one loved it. We were building 5–6 products in one.\n\nTwo years ago, we made the hardest call: cut the team back to 9. We removed everything from our product apart from one piece that customers loved.\n\nWe went back to our roots -> talking to customers, shipping fast, focusing on one thing that really matters.\n\nSince then, we’ve gone from 0 to 500K users. We work with some of the biggest companies in the world.\n\nI'm finally out of that dark tunnel. Still a lot of ways to fail, but I'm finally feeling confident!\n\nIf you're a founder going through something similar (I know a lot of people are post-2021/22) happy to chat or help however I can.",

    "chunk_text": "\"Looking for a Cofounder\" Is Just Code for \"Do My Work for Free\" [I will not promote] _Disclaimer: English isn’t my first language, so I used AI to help with grammar corrections and editing._\n\n_There’s a disease going around the startup scene: delusion. Way too many people think having an “idea” is enough to deserve a cut of someone else’s sweat, skills, and time. It’s not._\n\n_I saw a post the other day from a guy looking for a tech cofounder. The dude had absolutely nothing to offer. No experience, no marketing skills, no connections, no ability to raise money, no cash of his own. He even wrote in his pitch that he can’t raise money from friends or family. So what’s he bringing? Vibes?_\n\n_This is what happens when too many people binge content from fake gurus and get drunk on \"I landed a $200K offer in 2 hours learning Python\" videos. Add the AI hype train, and suddenly people think tech work is free and developers are disposable. Combine that with garbage hiring practices and stories of people sending out 200 job apps with zero offers, and yeah, the market feels broken. But that still doesn’t mean your napkin idea entitles you to a piece of someone else's life._\n\n_If you're offering nothing but an “idea,” you are dead weight. A liability. No one is building your dream for free just because you had a shower thought and posted about it. And if someone does work with you, they’ll cut you out the second they realize you add zero value. I've seen it happen over and over: founders begging for advice on how to get rid of a useless partner who thinks they deserve equity because they showed up with “the vision.”_\n\n_You have no leverage. Zero. Why would anyone NOT steal your idea and build it without you? Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything._\n\n_But this isn’t just a rant. It’s a wake-up call._\n\n_If you’re not technical, then you better be good at something else. Sales. Marketing. Design. Fundraising. Branding. Networking. Budgeting. Negotiation. Building pitch decks. Even just being willing to put your own money in the game gives you more skin in it than most._\n\n_You can learn these things. There are endless free resources out there. YouTube, Reddit, X, blogs, books. No excuses. A top contributor in this sub even posted an incredible guide on pitch decks recently. That stuff is pure gold._\n\n_Stop dreaming about being a founder. Start acting like one. Grind skills that matter. Break the big goals down and just do the next 10-minute task. It adds up._\n\n_You’ll screw up a lot. That’s part of the process. But be brutally honest with yourself about why things failed. Ego is the biggest killer of growth._\n\n_Now I want to hear from the real cofounders in this sub: what was your leverage? What did you bring to the table? And how did it play out?_",

The number of consumer VCs have shrunk drastically and those still in the game have much higher expectations around user traction before they're willing to put any money in.

But these days, they want to see traction first and/or a path to monetization, sometimes by Year 1.\n\nI almost gave up on the company because of all the negative feedback from the market. Now that I've actually raised, I feel rather skeptical about my own consumer vision and want to explore potential B2B2C or B2B opportunities as a hedge.

I won’t get into the financials but it was an OK exit, nothing crazy but not bad.  We struggled for a long time but eventually found our footing, built a a solid product and made revenue from big companies - then we sold!  This is for startups that are struggling and not exploding with success.\n\n1). The hardest part was team alignment during pivots.  When things are not going right everyone has an opinion and the CEO has to make the final call, and inevitably some % of people will be pissed.  This can take a big emotional toll.\n\n2). Your gut is usually right, and make the call sooner rather than later.  For vast majority of my decisions I never regretted going with my gut, only that I probably took too long to do it (probably due to point 1 above).  If you feel something isn’t right and needs to change, you’re probably right\n\n3). For marketing in the early days content is king, write awesome and probably controversial content with strong opinions to get viral blogs.  Paid ads on google or LinkedIn were a complete waste.  Founder lead marketing is the most economical way to do it\n\n4). Build a sticky product - we started with a quick value but very nonsticky product and nobody purchased it (it did demo well).  Then we went for a much stickier and highly integrated product that provided the same value and people started to pay (there were other benefits).  If people don’t use it everyday they won’t pay for it\n\n5). The CEO sets the vision, period.  Get in or get out.  Everyone on the team should either build the product or get customers, that’s it.  Be wary of hiring “experienced” people who just want a big title or play useless political games, or want to hire a bunch of people.  The early days should be more like a benevolent dictatorship and not a consensus driven team.  It’s ugly, a grind, and very tiring.",

Great idea, solid market research, seemed legit. We agreed on $15K for the MVP over 8 weeks.\n\nThree weeks in, everything's going smooth. Then he casually mentions during our check-in call that he needs it to handle \"enterprise-level security\" because his first client is a Fortune 500 company.\n\nWait, what?\n\nTurns out this \"startup MVP\" needed to be SOC 2 compliant, handle SSO, have audit logs, the whole enterprise package. Stuff that would easily double the timeline and budget.\n\nWhen I told him this changes everything, he got defensive. Said he \"assumed I knew\" and that \"all SaaS needs basic security.\" Basic security and enterprise compliance are completely different things.\n\nLong story short, he tried to find someone cheaper who would just \"figure it out.\" Last I heard, that project imploded after 4 months and two different developers.\n\nThe lesson? When a founder isn't 100% upfront about requirements, especially the expensive ones, run. They're either clueless about what they're asking for or deliberately hiding costs.\n\nFrom now I will ask super specific questions upfront: Who's your first customer? What compliance do you need?

Post discount, I paid $38k up front.\n\nTime went on, project officially started April 2nd. A few weeks later, a new person came on the call with a heavy middle eastern accent asking about what I expected as deliverables, I thought it was weird the American guy was there but continued. That was the last meeting I had with them, probably late April, you probably can fill in the rest.\n\nI’ve talked to multiple lawyers, I’m not in their bankruptcy creditor list because there are bigger pockets out there. I do intend to file a claim and be represented (another $1500) in hopes of some recuperation but there’s a 99% chance I lost it all. I’m SOL.\n\nLESSON LEARNED: Do not pay up front the total for your project, EVER.",

    "chunk_text": "First-time founder: Is 32% for CEO and 12% each for developers fair? I will not promote Hey, just a heads up that I'm very new to the business world. I am a recently graduated CS student who is a founding member of a startup along with four other recently graduated students. For reference, the core of our startup is an app. Our team is as follows: 4 developers, 1 CEO.\n\nWe're discussing equity distribution, and our CEO has proposed that the developers each get 12%, he would get 32%, and we would keep 20% as reserved ownership. As a newbie, I don't know if this is reasonable, so I'll break down the details below.\n\nOur CEO came up with the idea of the app last fall, and us four developers have been working on it since around October, though it was only part-time due to the fact that we were all students at the time. We developers each probably put in around 10 hrs/week across that time, while the CEO hasn't done much.\n\nThat being said, our app's success depends on signing on companies to use our app and we've agreed that the role of finding customers will fall to the CEO. We've almost got an MVP at this point and hope to launch a beta version at the end of this month, at which point our CEO says he'll start calling and meeting people like crazy. So far, the company hasn't required significant management, but I anticipate that it will as we transition into having actual clients, at which point the CEO's position will become more relevant. I should also note that the CEO has pledged $2,000 for starting capital. All of our work thus far has been unpaid.\n\nBeing new to business, I originally assumed that it was normal for the CEO to have a larger share of the company, but am I wrong? Should the numbers be more even? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also, I will not promote.\n\nEdit: I may have originally undersold our CEO. He has been doing market research and has met with some potential customers. In comparison to the time spent developing, though, he's stated himself that we've done the majority of work so far.",

Why did this revenue jump? What did you learn about customers that nobody else knows? What hypothesis completely changed your approach?\n\nThey want to see your thinking evolve in real time.

It's been 11 months - we're still pre-launch and have raised a modest friends and family round.\n\nI'm concerned that granting 7.5% dead equity will impact future financing. I've been advised that 1-5% is more typical in these situations, and I'm willing to offer 5%. But my co-founder isn't accepting 5% and is asking for at least 7.5%.\n\n**How can I part ways amicably without giving away 7.5% dead equity?**\n\nWhere it gets complicated: I naively agreed to 50/50 split in the beginning (influenced by *that* famous YC article), even though he was going to be part-time for a while. We're both scheduled to vest 10% each after one year, and now he's anchored on that number even though the original split was clearly unbalanced. We've been going back and forth about creating a new agreement for months but he simply doens't want to give up his equity.\n\nAt this point, the board is ready to move forward with the dismissal and grant zero equity, but I'd strongly prefer not go that route. I'd like to offer some equity in exchange for a clean separation agreement.\n\nWould appreciate any thoughts. Thank you!",

    "chunk_text": "Everything I learned from making a business that books don't teach (i will not promote) I've read tons of books on making business. It's taught me a lot, but some of the most valuable lessons were from actually building the product. This is some of what I've learned:\n\n1. Take long walks. Think aloud. Go through the current issues of your product and improve on it. All my best ideas have come from being on a walk. Also, keep a small notebook on you, so you can write ideas you have at any time.\n2. For each of your competitors, use their app and think of why someone would use that over yours. Then, don't just copy features. Understand the underlying user need they're solving and make a better way to meet it.\n3. Get lots of feedback! Spend lots of time engaging with your users. Start a Discord and make it very visible on the website, make the support email visible too.\n4. Innovation takes a long time (going from 0 to 1). But all you really have to do is keep trying different things, take what works, and then keep trying more. If you look at evolution, that is an example of how innovation can work. Evolution didn't know where it was going, it just tried many things for many years and eventually humans evolved into existence. Naval Ravikant once said \"It's not 10,000 hours, it's 10,000 iterations.\" Just keep iterating!\n5. How to market: Go into niche Reddits and write posts that provide lots of value, and make the reader naturally curious about the product. Don't say stuff like \"Check out [product name]!\". Market literally every day. There's a quote somewhere like \"Most products die because no one knows about them, not because their competitor killed them.\"\n6. Show that lots is happening. On my website, I have a changelog in the sidebar that shows \"new\" whenever I release an update. I release like 5 updates a day. Almost every day the user logs in, they can see that Varu AI has improved. Also, have a roadmap.\n7. Sit down with people in real life and watch as they use your product. If you can't use real users, ask your friends, family, etc. Take notes. This will help you figure out tons of issues about your product.\n\nI really hope this helps! If anyone has any other tips to add, comment them. I'd love to hear.",

    "chunk_text": "I used to emotionally bond with my employees, now I don’t even ask about their weekend. For nearly a decade I couldn’t figure out how to build a team so I could step out of the day to day operations. Looking back I think the biggest tactic that I tried repeatedly was trying to bond with my first few employees. In my business there is a ton of time when it’s just you and one other person for hours and hours every night. Eventually they start sharing things about their lives and I would do the same. A lot of them respected me because I was a bit older or they wanted a business so they would open up and ask me for advice. \n\nI thought this was the move. I thought develop close friendships these people would become my inner circle as we grew the business. I thought that they would see my dream and how hard I work and it would inspire them to invest long term. \n\nEventually they would emotionally manipulate me. Maybe not showing up on time or skipping critical tasks. They always developed a role of being my helper and not responsible for the job outcome. After enough time, they would completely flake out. I think the respected me so much and got so close that when they started slacking, it really effected their self esteem. They couldn’t handle dropping the ball and being called out repeatedly by someone too close, it was like my feedback was too heavy because it was tied to all of the other issues they were self conscious about. Like they felt like a failure to their soul and letting me down proves it. \n\nAt some point, after not being able to handle the turnover and emotional swings of losing people I spent so much time in, I decided to not get to know my employees at all. I was strictly business. I became hardened and did not want to get to know them or them to get to know me, we are just here to work and go home. So I built the job in a way they could work solo and I trained them in a way that I could trust them. I let them know from day one, these jobs are your responsibility, you’re not helping me, you’re going to do them start to finish so you need tk take an interest in the tools and processes.\n\nI gave them very clear instructions and made them feel like they could succeed by completing tasks correctly. I trained them slowly over time and didn’t get frustrated when they made simple mistakes. I also didn’t do their work for them to bail them out. \n\nEventually this core shift enabled me to hire entry level janitors off the street. People who initially took the job because they were passing time until a better job came along. These people slowly developed and I made leaders out of them. My team grew to over 35 people, and I hadn’t met most of them. I didn’t even talk to most people during their entire employment at my company. My team hired, trained, and terminated people. Even if those people worked her for years, I never personally interacted with them. \n\nIt might sound cold and distant but it’s not. I just allow them to do their job without any emotional weight from me. When they do well I promote and reward and I get to see these people develop over time and actually have a much bigger impact on their lives over a longer period. It’s from a distance but I know it’s making an impact because the first guy I raised up to a manager passed away a few months ago and his family has been calling me frequently and telling me how much the job meant to him and how proud they were to see him turn his life around in his final years.",

Diagnose and then confidently present the cure.\n\nAfter I started doing this, I closed 200+ deals for my freelancing business. From big tech companies all the way down to small mom-and-pop online stores.\n\nHere's the script that changed everything for me:\n\n# The mindset\n\nBefore we get into the \"what to say,\" we need to fix the \"how to think.\" This is 90% of the battle.\n\n* Your job isn't to push a product; it's to diagnose a problem. You should be listening, asking intelligent questions, and determining **if you're even the right person to help them**. If a doctor listened to your symptoms for 30 seconds and immediately tried to sell you on a specific surgery, you'd run. Don't be that person.\n* In the first half of the call, the client should be doing 80% of the talking. If you're talking more than them, you're pitching, not discovering. You're losing.\n* You don't need this client. You are evaluating them just as much as they are evaluating you. Think of it like a first date. You're not trying to force a second date from the moment you sit down. You're genuinely trying to see if there's a connection and if you're compatible for a long-term relationship.\n* Do not read this word-for-word. Reading makes you sound like a robot and breaks all trust.\n\n# Preparation\n\nGood prep is going to be the source of your confidence. Knowing your questions and your offer ahead of time frees up your mental energy to actively listen.\n\n1. Go through the steps below and write down 3-5 specific questions for each section.\n2. **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Prepare 1-3 clear service packages with prices**. Even if you won’t be able to pitch a productized service, this will help you quickly and without hesitation answer ANY questions regarding your pricing (e.g. \"I've done similar projects for around $4.000). This makes you look like someone who’s been doing this for years, is a professional and even **allows you to close the deal on the call** instead of letting the momentum die with a \"let me get back to you with a proposal.\"\n\n**The biggest mistake most people make is to NOT talk about pricing.**\n\nTalking about pricing massively speeds up the sales process, because prospects can either accept your offer immediately, decline it, or try a delay tactic.\n\nIf they accept - then great!\n\nIf they decline or delay, you can ASK them why, and you’ll find out a lot about the objections they have about working with you.\n\n# The warm-up\n\nSpending 2-3 minutes on small talk shows you’re a relaxed, normal person, which helps the prospect relax, too.\n\n* What to Say:\n   * “I see you're based in Austin. I've heard great things about the food scene there.”\n   * “I have to mention this, you picked the best Zoom background.”\n   * “Glad we could connect before the weekend. Any exciting plans?”\n\nThen, transition and set the frame. This is crucial for taking control.\n\n* \"Awesome! Well, I’m excited to chat. Should we dive right in?\" (Wait for \"yes\")\n* \"Great. So the way I usually run these calls is I'll start by asking a few questions to get a really clear picture of your business and what you're looking for. If it sounds like I can definitely help, I’ll explain how I work. Sound good?\"\n\n# Discovery\n\nThis is your \"doctor\" phase. Start broad and then go deep.\n\n* **If they reached out to you:** \"So, to start, I’d love to hear what prompted you to book this call today? What’s going on in your business?\"\n* **If you reached out to them:** \"When I reached out, something in my message must have clicked. What was it that made you decide to take this call?\"\n\nNow, shut up and listen. Take notes. After their initial answer, dig deeper with your prepared, service-specific questions.\n\n* **Pro-Tip:** If they give short, unhelpful answers, use this: **\"Could you tell me a bit more about that?\"**\n\n# Their experience\n\nAre you talking to a seasoned pro or a total beginner? The answer dictates how you'll pitch later on and what kind of questions to ask.\n\n* \"Have you tackled this issue before? What worked or didn’t work?\"\n* \"Have you worked with another freelancer or agency on this? What was that like?\"\n\nThis tells you what they value, what they hate, and what landmines to avoid. If they say their last designer was a \"terrible communicator,\" you know to highlight your communication process in your pitch.\n\nOn the other hand if they tell you they've had 20 freelancers on this and that they all sucked, you should probably run away.\n\n# Defining success\n\nThis is where you move from their problems to their aspirations.\n\n* \"Okay, let's fast forward 6 months. If we were to work together on this, what would need to have happened for you to feel like this was a huge success?\"\n* \"What would achieving \\[their goal\\] actually do for your business? Why is this a priority right now?\"\n\nWhen they answer this, they are literally selling themselves on the value of your service. Write down their exact words.\n\n# Uncovering roadblocks\n\nWhy their problem still exists. This is the bridge to your pitch.\n\n* \"So you’re looking to achieve \\[their goal\\]. What’s held you back from getting this done on your own so far?\"\n* \"Why do you think you haven't found the right person to help with this yet?\"\n\nTheir answer here is pure gold. It gives you the exact angle for your pitch.\n\n* If they say \"I don't have the time,\" your solution is about a hands-off, \"done-for-you\" process.\n* If they say \"I don't have the expertise,\" your solution is about your deep knowledge and strategic guidance.\n\n# The pitch\n\nSee how late this comes? You should only pitch after you fully understand their situation.\n\n* **Ask for permission:** \"Okay, based on everything you've told me, I have a very clear picture of the situation. I'm confident I can help you achieve \\[Their Goal\\]. Would it be okay if I walk you through how I'd approach it?\"\n* **Frame it:** \"Great. So I specialize in helping \\[businesses like them\\] to \\[achieve the exact goal they just told you\\].\"\n* **Show proof:** \"For example, last quarter I worked with \\[Similar Client\\], who was struggling with \\[Similar Problem\\]. We implemented this process and they were able to \\[Achieve Result\\].\"\n* **Explain the process:** Walk them through the steps.\n   * \"First, we’d start with a kickoff session to...\"\n   * \"Next, I’ll prepare xyz to...\"\n   * \"Finally, you’ll get...\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT REVEAL YOUR PRICING OR PACKAGES AT THIS POINT! Focus solely on the workflow and deliverables.\n\nAfter you're done, ask them:\n\n*  \"That’s the general overview. What questions do you have about that for me?\"\n\nWhen they run out of process questions, they will almost always ask the big one: \"So... how much does it cost?\" This is the moment you've been waiting for.\n\n* \"The cost for the package I just described is $7,500.\"\n\nState your price clearly and confidently. Then, the most important part:\n\n**BE SILENT.**\n\nDo not justify it. Do not explain it. Do not say \"but we can be flexible.\" The first person who talks, loses. Let them react. Their reaction tells you everything you need to know.\n\n# Handling objections\n\nAn objection is not a \"no.\" It's a request for more information or reassurance. Don't get defensive. You can't handle an objection if you don't know what they're thinking. So your first job is to figure out what they're trying to say.\n\n**\"That's more expensive than I was expecting\"**\n\n* \"I understand. Can I ask what you were budgeting for a project like this?\" OR \"Could you tell me a bit more about what makes it feel expensive?\" (This helps you understand if it's a value problem or a cash flow problem).\n\n**\"I need to think about it.\"**\n\n* \"That’s perfectly fine; most of my best clients take time to think. Just so I can understand, what specific part of it do you need to think about most?\"\n\n**\"Why would I pay this much when I can get someone on Fiverr for $500?\"**\n\n* \"That's a fair question. You're right, there are definitely cheaper options out there, and for simple tasks, they can be great. The question is, are you looking to buy a task, or are you looking to buy a business outcome? A task-doer will do exactly what you say. I see my role as a strategic partner to help you achieve \\[their goal\\]. Which of those is more important to you right now?\"\n\n(I've got more objections and how to handle them in the google docs I'm linking below)\n\n# The close\n\nIf they agree with your price and want to move forward, you're not done yet. You need to handle the final step professionally.\n\n* Immediately explain the next steps. \"Great! Here’s what will happen next. I'm going to send over the contract and an invoice for the initial deposit. Once that's handled, I'll send you a link to book our kickoff call.\"\n* Don't just hang up after that! Spend 2-3 minutes returning to small talk. This calms their nerves, eases potential buyer's remorse, and reinforces that you're a human they're building a relationship with, not just a vendor who got their money.\n\n# Extra info\n\nI've put some extra objection handling examples, more info, more examples, etc. into a Google Doc which I'm linking in a comment below, to keep this post on point.  \n  \nThis all takes practice to master so I also created a ChatGPT Monster prompt that will roleplay different levels of clients (easy to hard). I'm also including it at the bottom of the doc.",

    "chunk_text": "I've sold my bootstrapped software company for 7 figures after working on it for 2 years while keeping a day job. AMA I started my company in 2023 after building a ton of solutions looking for problems.  I'm a software engineer who's always fucking loved writing code.  I can't stop.  I'm always building and if I'm not I'm depressed. I built a SaaS tool at the behest of my wife, a PHD chemist, to solve a real problem she was having.  \n\nThe thing is, just as I was starting to see success and the potential to pay myself from this side project we got pregnant.  I wasn't going to risk the future of my child on an (semi)unproven software idea. So I kept my day job and worked 60 hours a week (40 at the day job, 20 at the start up) to scale the business.  So many things hit at once though and it was an exceptionally stressful time towards the end.  \n\nFast forward another year and I have an 8 month old and 6 people working on this side-project-that's-gotten-out-of-hand. I was still working a day job and incredibly burnt out.  Again, not willing to risk my future on the business at this stage in my life, I started looking for a buyer.  I found 3, one via outreach on LinkedIn another via a networking event that happened a year prior, and another was a contact I knew.  I ultimately took the riskiest deal, so less cash up front but more upside potential and much more interesting work.\n\nAt the end of the day, I owned 85.5% of the company I sold and now have this sale as a feather in my cap.   I'm currently back to being a standard W-2 employee only, albeit a founding engineer at the company that acquired mine.  It's such a mixture of happiness, anxiety and, oddly enough, numbness to the sale.  I feel like I'm still working on awesome stuff, but fundamentally my life hasn't changed.  We'll have the house paid off, and the kids college fund paid for, but I'm still just a working stiff.",

WRONG. about 3 months ago I start getting these IRS notices about late payroll tax deposits and I'm like what the actual hell because I thought this was all automated. turns out their system had been depositing our taxes late for 8 weeks straight, EIGHT WEEKS, due to some \"technical error\" they never bothered mentioning and now we owe $15k in penalties. but wait it gets worse because apparently our state tax withholdings for remote employees have been completely fucked since january so now we owe employees back pay plus another $12k in penalties and I had no idea because Gusto never flagged it. then I find out they also missed filing our Q1 forms on time so that's more penalties and I'm just sitting there realizing these people literally had ONE job and managed to fail at every single part of it while charging me hundreds of dollars a month. called them and got the usual SaaS runaround \"we're looking into it\" and \"technical difficulties\" and when I finally got someone to admit their system was glitching they said they \"didn't want to alarm customers\" like excuse me?? I'm getting penalty notices from the fucking IRS but you didn't want to ALARM me?? had to hire an emergency accountant and lawyer just to figure out how screwed we were and lost probably another week of productivity dealing with this shit instead of running my actual business and the whole time Gusto kept charging us while their broken system was actively destroying everything.\n\nended up switching to another service called Thera but honestly I’m already traumatized by the last provider to say any other pro’s besides it being cheaper. check everything twice, ask stupid questions, basically paranoid about payroll forever.\n\nanyway fuck SaaS companies that promise automation then disappear when their shit breaks.\n\nedit: price",

I have a degree, sent out job applications for months and still no breakthrough. \n\nOne day while visiting a friend in Arusha, I noticed something,onions were way cheaper there than in Nairobi. significantly cheaper. I didn’t think much of it at first. But when I came back home and mentioned it to a street grocery vendor near my place her reaction made me just do it she said “If you can get me onions at a lower price i will buy”\n\nFew weeks Iater i went to a Border city btn Tanzania and Kenya called Namanga with some saved cash and bought about 70kg of onions. No shipping,no drama. I tossed my sacks into the back of a passenger bus. My onions  stayed under 1 tonne, so I didn’t need to deal with tariffs or too much agricultural import laws. \n\nI repacked them into 1kg bags and started supplying small food vendors and small grocery store owners . They loved it. I was saving them money, and I was making a small but steady profit about €0.20 per kilo profit. Doesn’t sound like much but it adds up fast when you move a few hundred kilos every week.\n\nAll this came from something so simple. A basic product. A gap in the system. And just being willing to move.\n\nNow I’m thinking bigger. Maybe I’ll rent a car and start shipping close to 1 tonne. I’ve got regular clients now, and I know there’s more demand out there.\n\nI welcome any questions and opinions. Thanks",

While I didn't literally beg people for the things I wanted from them, they innevitably felt it.\n\nThey saw it in my face. Deep inside of me, I was desperate. The way I looked at them, the way I talked to them, the weakness that was conveyed simply by framing things in a specific way.\n\nNobody wants to buy from somebody, that gives us \"beta vibes\". While this term seems shallow, it has a deep biological significance. If you sell an exceptional product or service, but you give the prospect the feeling that they will lose with you, they won't buy. \n\nAnd losing can be interpreted in many ways. Reputational loss, attractivity loss, financial loss, loss of power, ... everybody has unique causes for not doing what we want them to do (despite the sale itsself).\n\nSo one day, this has changed for me. I met this one person that turned my life upside down.

I seek rejection, because that makes me grow and worst case sort out the wrong people\".\n\nUntil today, I believe this is the biggest multiplicator for success or failure in life and especially business.

    "chunk_text": "How I went from $400 proposals to $20k+ projects 8 years ago I started my first job as a copywriter for a company that sold supplements. The pay wasn't great, and I couldn't move out of my parents place. This was why I wanted to try freelancing, I figured I might as well write for other businesses and try to double my paycheck that way.\n\nI had no idea where to find clients or how to sell myself, so I asked friends if they knew anyone who might need copy. Got my first gig that way for $200 per month writing weekly emails.\n\nThe hustle was real. I was sending hundreds of cold emails, joining Facebook groups, basically doing anything to find clients. And honestly, I was landing some work. But there was this weird pattern I kept noticing.\n\nI'd have these amazing discovery calls where prospects were nodding along, asking great questions, clearly interested. Then I'd send my proposal and... radio silence. Or they'd come back with \"we've decided to go in another direction.\"\n\nIt was crushing my confidence. I started thinking maybe I wasn't good enough, maybe my prices were too high, maybe I should just accept smaller projects.\n\nThen something clicked during a conversation with a client who gave me some feedback. I asked her what made her pass over me for another freelancer. Her answer completely changed how I thought about freelancing.\n\nShe said \"honestly, your proposal just looked so sloppy. Let me show you what I got from the other person. It just looks like they put in a lot of work into everything and I was worried your work would be as sloppy as your proposal.\"\n\nThat hit me like a brick. She was right. My proposals were basic Google Docs with barely any formatting. Just plain text with my services listed out and a price at the bottom. Meanwhile, this other freelancer had sent her something that looked like it came from a real agency.\n\nThat's when I realized something: Clients often can't judge the quality of your actual work because they don't understand it. A small business owner doesn't know what makes good copy. A startup founder can't tell the difference between decent design and great design.\n\nSo they judge you based on what they CAN evaluate. Your communication. Your professionalism. How you present yourself.\n\nI call this \"window dressing.\"\n\nThink about it. When you walk into a restaurant, you can't taste the food before ordering. So you judge based on the menu design, the cleanliness, how the staff presents themselves, etc. Same thing happens with freelancing.\n\nThat brutal feedback was exactly what I needed to hear. That day I decided to completely overhauled how I presented myself. Instead of sending scrappy one-page proposals in Google Docs, I started creating beautiful, detailed proposals that looked like they came from an established agency.\n\nThe difference was immediate and dramatic.\n\nProjects that used to pay me $400 were suddenly paying $1-3k. Then $5k+. Then $10k+. \n\nI just kept raising my prices until I hit a wall, and then I just kept adding value to be able to increase my prices even further.\n\nBut here's the thing that really surprised me. The higher-paying clients were actually EASIER to work with. They trusted my expertise more. They asked for fewer revisions. They referred me to other high-value clients.\n\nIt turns out that when you present yourself professionally, you attract professional clients who value what you do.\n\nThe proposal I developed became my secret weapon. It has sections for project overview, detailed timeline, clear deliverables, and even a confidentiality statement that makes me look established. It's 4 pages at a minimum, and it doesn't matter if I'm pitching a 2k landing page or a 20k funnel redesign. I've used variations of this same proposal to land everything from small local business projects to work with venture-backed startups. Everyone would rather work with a freelancer who has professionally designed assets.\n\nThe crazy part is also just how much time I save. Instead of writing each proposal from scratch, I just customize the Canva template I built. Takes me maybe 10 minutes instead of 2 hours.\n\nSo if you're struggling with getting ghosted after sending proposals or feel like you're stuck in a cycle of low-paying projects, the issue might not be your skills. It might be how you're packaging and presenting those skills to potential clients.\n\nSometimes you need that brutal honest feedback to see what's really holding you back. That client did me a huge favor by being direct with me, even though it stung at the time.\n\nWindow dressing matters more than we want to admit. But once you embrace that reality and tidy up your entire online persona, everything becomes easier.",

Here’s why this approach works Unpopular opinion: \"Cloning\" a tool in a saturated market is honestly one of the most underrated ways to win as a first time founder.\n\nI know everyone says you need to build something crazy and unique most of the profitable indie SaaS I see is basically an \"alternative to X, but with one thing done better.\"\n\nWhen I started, I thought making yet another data scraper was pointless. \"So many players, why bother?\" But after seeing tons of \"unique\" projects with literally zero users (even though they sometimes score some early investment!), I switched it up.\n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, I picked a busy niche, cloned the basics, and obsessed over just one real customer pain that everyone else ignored. Didn’t even try to make it \"the best ever\", just \"the best for THIS thing.\"\n\nIt actually worked. Not a unicorn story, but I got paying users faster than with any original/innovative idea. Turns out people in crowded markets already understand their problems and want simple solutions, not magic.\n\nWhy do we act like making a good alternative isn’t a win? If you’re a first time founder, copy what works and just improve a few things. Forget the \"unique genius\" pressure.",

    "chunk_text": "Ticker Nerd started on reddit and sold to a $500m company Saw a breakdown of Ticker Nerd (Luc and Sam's newsletter that spots trending stocks) and how it pulled serious revenue and got bought out for big bucks (there's a great AMA thread with them but due to sub rules I can't post it). The synopsis is:\n\n- Had their idea Nov 2020, started building. They wanted to answer the question “What if we could find out which stocks the Internet is talking about?” which at the time was something MUCH HARDER than it is now\n- 9 months after that idea and initial build, they sold to Finder, an aussie fintech worth half a billion dollars\n\n*COMING UP WITH AN IDEA*\n- They think: You don't need a revolutionary/original idea to build a business. There are heaps of boring businesses that make over 7 figs a year\n\n*IDEA VALIDATION*\n- They think: The most important thing is working out if people will pay money for your idea. \n- They actually had a really overwhelming and confusing process for idea validation, with cards/templates/canva/gumroad... This could have been simplified a lot. \n- The one thing that stood out to me is that they make a VERY SIMPLE MVP and they started to try to get sales straight away at a very cheap price. The price doesn't matter, it's the interest that does.\n\n*HOW THEY GOT THEIR FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS*\n- They shared their business through all the reddit subs you'd expect, as well as facebook groups and product hunt (which at the time was much more useful) and sign ups happened organically from there. Seems easy, right?\n- What actually threw me is how much EASIER it sounded than the current economics of building a SaaS. It's simplified because a) there are WAY LESS channels to launch on, so you have a bigger audience, and b) the barrier to entry was way higher 4 years ago.\n\n Do you think their success more about picking the right niche, having the right time, or having early validation before scaling?\n\nMy take:\n- Agree that audience is gold,  if you don't build what they actually want, you risk building in a vacuum of your own head / the opinions of people who aren't your customer. You need TANGIBLE evidence that your idea is worth something, through pre launch sign ups or other means. But even before then, there are tools now that will help you prove out a market before you dive in head first.\n- Real validation (not just \"likes\" or email signups) is imperative saves months of work - you really need to consider doing this if you want to succeed and not just build off what is 'cool' or 'feels right'. But timing is also important.\n- Ticker Nerd nailed both - validated interest, then leveraged that into revenue\n\nFor anyone trying to replicate that playbook: focus on solving a real pain, and use every tool (AI or otherwise) to shortcut the time from idea to validation. Don't fall for the vanity metric trap - actual paying users > hype / mums opinion. \n\nFor me personally: I raised $70k on Kickstarter for my board game,  the whole thing hinged on getting real feedback *before* building out the product. For that reason I'm now building a tool I wish I had then: IdeaFloat (you guessed it - a tool that systematically validates your business idea with real data), to prevent people like me from wasting their time and money. Validation should make you money and save you time if done right.",

    "chunk_text": "Social Media Scheduling: My Evolving Toolkit (And Why I Built One) Hey everyone,\n\nBeen a while since I last posted an update here. I wanted to share a bit about my journey with social media management, and how it's led me to build my own tool, SocialBu.\n\nI know, I know - another social media tool, right? But hear me out. It wasn't born out of a desire to compete, but rather from scratching my own itch.\n\nI was running multiple accounts for different projects and clients and found myself juggling so many different platforms for scheduling, engagement, and analytics. Each platform had its own quirks, and the whole process felt incredibly disjointed. I felt so limited and most tools at that time were either too expensive or didn't have what i wanted.\n\nSo, I started building SocialBu to solve my problems. Here’s what I focused on:\n\n* Content writing, curation, publishing, repeating, and with all post options for each social network (alt text, threads, and so on)\n* Consolidation: A single inbox for all social interactions.\n* Automation that Doesn't Suck: Workflows to automate content curation and posting (think RSS to social and webhooks).\n* AI Assistance: For generating content and suggesting relevant articles. It's actually pretty handy. Its evolving every day.\n* Team Collaboration: Post approvals and easy team member invites. This has been a huge time-saver.\n* Powerful API. With automation in mind, i wanted to give the power to others\n\nNow, I'm not here to pitch SocialBu. I'm sharing this because building it has been a real entrepreneurial ride. The insights I've gained from the community here have shaped the direction it has taken. The journey of building something you use yourself and solve problems has been amazing.\n\nI'm curious to hear your experiences, especially if you've faced similar challenges in the social media space. And, is anyone successfully automating social media content? Using AI to create content that actually is not spam?\n\nEnjoy the ride, fellow entrepreneurs!",

Since then, I’ve read over 40 of his essays. These writings are rightly considered among the best materials on startups and, in general, are incredibly insightful and thought-provoking. Paul Graham has published all his essays on his blog since the early days of YC.\n\nThe main challenge I faced was finding enough time to read them—many essays span several pages. For a long time, I’ve dreamed of a service that could transform these essays into audiobooks, but I couldn’t find anything convenient. So, we decided to create our own.\n\nWe’ve built an app where you can listen to all 227 of Paul Graham’s essays as audiobooks for free. The app’s interface resembles a standard podcast application—simple, intuitive, and familiar. The voice quality is excellent, making it easy to listen for hours.\n\nAdditional features include:\n\n• The ability to download all audio files directly to your phone for offline listening.\n\n• A Text-to-Speech functionality allowing you to convert any text into audio.\n\n• The option to save audio files to your device and share them with other apps.\n\nTo access all the content, download the free Frateca app and enter the promo code paulgraham in the settings. Afterward, you’ll find all 227 audio essays in your library.\n\nThe app is called Frateca and is available on the App Store and Google Play.\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback! 🙏",

I Google searched and found various methods such as video marketing, social media SEO etc. But none of them were easy for me, and I was not even interested in learning them.\n\nThen one fine day, I came across a post here on Reddit. A guy was sharing lead generation methods through his posts. I DMed him and he suggested writing content, video marketing, and other methods. I picked blogging among others, as I love reading every day. I read at least 50 pages. This is one of my hobbies, I think.\n\nSo, I asked him to write blogs for me and shared the details of my affiliate product \\[a psychological treatment course primarily for women.\\] I also explained the goal behind this blogging campaign.\n\nThat guy was a really very genuine, honest and had more knowledge than most of the marketing gurus making videos on YouTube. I simply paid him the amount he deserved, and I asked him to publish 50 blogs for me. In a month, he published 71 blogs. Wow!! More than my expectations.\n\nHe wrote blogs that directly answered people’s queries. I paid him $700 for this project. The best part, all blogs were SEO optimised, which is why a couple of them were ranking in Google search too, through my Medium account.\n\nFor the next quarter, I saw thousands of clicks on my affiliate link. The maximum sign-up I got in a day was 26. Whenever I checked my inbox, I saw emails titled “**commission earned**”. The most satisfying feelings in the world.\n\nI earned a total of $7,645 in just three months. Unfortunately, the agency later shut down their affiliate program, sad!! But by that time, I had already made ten times my initial investment, all while doing nothing, just sitting idle in my room.\n\n**Moral of the story**: Hire an expert to do the work for you, and enjoy the life you deserve.\n\nGood Luck!!",

But dude, all I saw were people dancing on Reels, posting polished personal brands, and acting like you had to be an extrovert to win on social. That wasn’t me.\n\nI didn’t wanna be an influencer. I just wanted to build something real—quietly.\n\nSo I started experimenting.\n\n📌 **Step 1: I used ChatGPT like a ghostwriter**.  \nI asked it to write bold opinions on marketing that would start arguments in the comments. I didn’t care about likes—I wanted engagement. Every opinion = a new post idea. It was like having a content team for free.\n\n🎥 **Step 2: I turned those ideas into faceless Reels**.  \nI used CapCut + B-roll + trending audio. No voice, no face, just subtitles and solid storytelling. The first one flopped. The second one flopped. The third? 42K views in a weekend. I was shook.\n\n📊 **Step 3: I studied what worked and doubled down**.  \nI realized people don’t care *who* you are. They care *how you make them feel*. Make them curious, mad, or inspired—and they’ll watch till the end. That’s the game.\n\nNow my little faceless page gets DMs every day. I’ve even landed a few clients just from posting consistently.\n\nI’m not special. I just stopped overthinking and let AI do half the work.\n\nIf you’re in the same boat—awkward on camera, overwhelmed by “personal branding”—I got you. I share everything I’ve learned (and messed up) in my newsletter.  \nNo fluff. Just real strategies that work when you're broke, shy, and hungry.\n\nIt’s called *Quiet Hustler HQ*.

    "chunk_text": "# How I finally figured out how to make money with apps \n\nHi Reddit, I wanted to share something that completely changed how I approach app development, in case it helps anyone else who's building and feeling stuck.\n\nFor a long time, I thought the way to succeed with side projects was to just keep building. My process looked something like this:\n\n1. Get excited about an idea\n2. Design the whole thing in Photoshop (at the time)\n3. Build the MVP\n4. Launch quietly\n5. Tweak the landing page\n6. Wonder why no one’s signing up\n7. Add more features\n8. Repeat step 7\n\nIt felt productive. I was always working on something. But nothing ever really got traction — and definitely didn’t make money. It drove me crazy.\n\nWhat finally changed my mindset was reading The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. It’s a book about bottlenecks in manufacturing, but it applies perfectly to building products:\n\n> If you improve anything that isn’t the constraint, you’re just adding complexity.\n> \n\nOnce I started thinking in terms of *constraints*, everything shifted.\n\nInstead of asking, “What should I build next?”\n\nI started asking: “What’s actually stopping someone from paying me?” That’s “the” goal.\n\nIn most cases, it wasn’t a missing feature. It was something embedded in the process of something that already existed, like:\n\n- The landing page headline was vague—so users never clicked the download button\n- The signup form asked for too much info—so users never got to experience the product\n- The onboarding showed users how to use the app, but not why—so users never got value\n\nAfter a while, I figured out that every step of the “funnel” is important, but especially the step right before people fall off. That’s your bottleneck.\n\nI develop apps as a freelancer now. One client I worked with had a really solid product — great retention, real customer results — but almost no one was converting. The problem wasn’t the tool. It was the storytelling.\n\nWe added a simple “How It Works” page: a clean, visual 3-step walkthrough that explained exactly what the product did and why it mattered. That alone gave them a meaningful boost in conversions and helped unlock their path to 7-figure ARR.\n\nNot because we added more! Just because we focused on the real constraint.\n\nAnyway, I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately because I’ve started my own side project from scratch after some time just freelancing and figured I’d share.\n\nIf you're building something and it’s not landing the way you hoped, happy to chat in the comments — I’ve definitely been there.",

Shutting down this week I've spent about $70k and 2 years developing a photo quality enhancement app, and it has completely failed. Now, at the end of this week, the project will be shut down.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I decided to launch my own photo quality enhancement app. Even back then, it was clear the idea was likely doomed to fail due to high competition, but I took the risk. Development took quite a long time due to my own time-management mistakes and making poor choices when selecting contractors/team members. A lot of research was done to find the best open-source solutions, and many tests were conducted. We put together the best stack we could and optimized these models to run on CPU without quality loss, achieving very high processing speeds. We managed to reduce server costs down to just $450 per month while maintaining a good capacity for parallel processing.\n\nIn the end, in my opinion, it turned out to be a decent product. **It offers six enhancement modes: overall quality enhancement, color enhancement, dark photo enhancement, upscaling, colorization, and old photo restoration.** I believe it performs as well as, and in some places even better than, many competitors. It was launched in September of last year.\n\n**You can find the app at this link:** https://apps.apple.com/app/eppic-improve-photo-quality/id6447643567\n\nWhat was done during this time?\n\nI went through 3 completely different UI/UX designs. Tried 3 different business models:\n\n1. 3 free attempts per day with ads and a subscription option.\n2. Watermarks for the free version.\n3. A hard paywall when trying to save the photo.\n\nSome models were completely reworked based on typical user uploads. Various ASO strategies and optimizations were carried out. **Currently, the app uses a subscription model with weekly and monthly options.** However, the subscription conversion rate is so low that it doesn't even make sense to try spending money on ads where the cost per install can reach $10.\n\nIn total, over the entire period, I've made $200 in profit, with about 20 installs per day.\n\nAs I understand it, selling the app is impossible given such an audience and profit. Even acquaintances didn't want to take it over for free to continue development and cover server costs.\n\nAs sad as it sounds, it's time to shut it down. Before I do, please tell me, what did I do wrong, besides launching at the wrong time in a highly competitive market? Could I have done anything differently? Can it be sold for a small amount? And is there still any chance to save it? Any critique is welcome, even the harshest\n\nThanks again for all the feedback and support.\n\n**A few examples in comparison with one of the most popular competitors, R\\*\\*ini**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jchdrd1bgd3f1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d76eadd4c0a5acea346d60ac673bb220c587a2e",

    "chunk_text": "5 brutal lessons I learned after My failed EdTech startup cost me $20k and 11 months. After spending close to a year and 20 grand of my hard earned money, I am closing down my indiehacker hustle. Here are 5 lessons I learnt the hard way:\n\n1. Validation isn’t enough\n“Validate before you code,” they say. I did. I had a waitlist, even some verbal commitments to pay. But unless money actually hits your account month after month, it’s not validation. Worse, each customer wanted something different. As a solo dev, I couldn’t meet all the expectations. A waitlist means nothing unless people are truly paying and sticking.\n\n2. Your initial network is everything\nIn the early days, speed of feedback is gold. If you’re building a dev tool and you know devs, feedback is quick. I was building for teachers, but I wasn’t in that world — no school, no college, no direct access. Build for the people you can reach. Bonus points if they’re active online.\n\n3. B2B is brutal for a side hustle\nI tried reaching out to universities. Between timezone gaps, job commitments, and the effort required for enterprise sales, it wasn’t feasible. B2B is a full-time game. If you can’t dedicate yourself to sales calls, follow-ups, and meetings — don’t go there part-time.\n\n4. Some industries are just hard\nHealthcare, education, energy, governance — these aren’t indie hacker-friendly. Long sales cycles, regulatory mazes, slow-moving institutions. People can sniff find out side-hustles and lose interest. If you're not full-time or VC-backed, think twice before jumping in.\n\n5. Don’t build for two users\nI built for both teachers and students. Like marketplaces with buyers and sellers, these are hard to balance. You can't optimize for both equally. And adoption dies if one side finds it lacking. If you're a solo developer or a bootstrapped team focus on single-user products. It’s simpler, faster, and much easier to get right.\n\nEDIT 1 (28/05/2025)\n\nThank you so much for your supporting words. Many of you asked what I was building,so I will add some context.\n\nIt was an AI tool that helped with assessment of STEM subjects. Doing assessments is manual and takes away a lot of time from teaching, so that was a pain point confirmed by many teachers I spoke to.\n\nHowever the tool itself had run into the following pitfalls:\n\n1. It was difficult to make custom adjustments to integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS) for each educational institution\n2. Multiple decision makers (deans/directors), who themselves weren't users (teachers)\n3. Seasonal sales cycles which meant I couldn't sell anything during the academic year\n4. Very price sensitive\n\nIt is not that my tool was completely new, there are similar tools doing quite well (I know a few of those founders). All of them are:\n1. VC backed (one of them is funded by OpenAI, 2 by YC)\n2. Founders were fully invested (unlike me who was doing it as a side hustle)\n3. Founder market fit (founders were either teachers or students) which gave quick access to a good network for quick feedback",

Polished every damn pixel. Tested it till you wanted to scream. Launched with sweaty palms and a heart full of hope...\n\n...And then? Crickets.\n\nMaybe a few pity clicks from your mom. Maybe your cofounder shared it. But the grand, worldchanging tidal wave of users you envisioned? Nah. Just a sad little puddle. Radio silence. That gut punch when you refresh the analytics dashboard for the 500th time and see... basically nothing. Yeah. That. It sucks. It feels like showing up to your own surprise party and finding an empty room with a single, slightly deflated balloon.\n\nBuilding it is the EASY part. Seriously. The code, the design, the logistics  that's just mechanics. It's hard work, but it's predictable. You solve problem A, then B, then C. Building is linear. Getting people to give a single flying fk? That's a whole different, messy, chaotic beast.\n\n\"If you build it, they will come\" is the biggest load of bullsht ever sold. Field of Dreams lied to us. Kevin Costner owes us all an apology. The internet is a screaming, overcrowded bazaar. Nobody is just magically gonna stumble upon your meticulously crafted masterpiece unless you shove it in their face (politely, persistently, creatively).\n\nThat silence? It's not about your product being bad. (Okay, maybe it is. Be ruthlessly honest with yourself later). But often? It's about invisibility. You didn't scream loud enough in the right places. Your message was confusing. You talked features when they needed pain relief. You aimed for the wrong crowd. You launched... and then just waited. Big mistake. Huge.\n\nHere’s where the real work begins. The work that separates the dreamers from the doers who actually make sht happen:\n\nStop Whining, Start Diagnosing (Like a Scientist, Not a Sad Sack): Ditch the ego. Get brutal. Why exactly did they not come? Was the landing page confusing as hell? Did the signup flow suck? Was your pricing insane? Did you tell literally anyone outside your immediate family? Track down 5 real humans who should want this and ask them, point blank: \"Would yu pay for this? Why the hell not?\" Listen. Actually hear the pain. Don't argue. Just absorb the gut punches.\n\nForget \"Growth Hacking,\" Focus on \"Survival Grinding\": Viral loops? Scaling magic? Save it. Right now, you need ONE person to genuinely love what you made. Then find another. Then another. Manual outreach. DMs that aren't spammy but actually helpful. Comments in communities where your people actually hang out (not just spamming your link). Be a human, solve their problem, then maybe mention your thing. It's slow. It's tedious. It feels beneath you. Do it anyway.\n\nPivot or Persevere? (Hint: It's Rarely Pure Persevere): Maybe your core idea is gold, but the packaging is trash. Maybe you solved a problem nobody actually has. Be willing to tear it down and rebuild. Not starting from scratch, but adapting. Listen to those early users obsessively. What one tiny feature made their eyes light up? Double down on that. Kill the rest. Ruthlessly.\n\nEmbrace the Suck (It's Your New Best Friend): This feeling? This crushing disappointment? This is the forge. This is where you either melt or turn into fking steel. Every founder who made it past the first hurdle has been right here in this empty room with the deflated balloon. It’s a rite of passage. The difference is they used that feeling. Fuel. Pure, unadulterated fuel. Let it piss you off enough to try harder, smarter, louder.\n\nLook, building something from nothing is insane. It takes guts most people don't have. You did that part. Seriously, pat yourself on the back, you magnificent lunatic. Now, the universe is testing you. It’s asking: \"How badly do you really want this?\"\n\nAre you gonna let a little silence stop you? Are you gonna let the fear of looking stupid prevent you from shouting from the rooftops? Are you gonna let the initial indifference crush your belief in what you made?\n\nOr are you gonna get up, wipe the pizza grease off your chin, learn from the deafening silence, and start banging the damn drum LOUDER and SMARTER?\n\nThe first launch failed. So fking what? That was just the rehearsal. The real show starts now. Get back out there. Iterate. Shout. Connect. Grind. Make them see what you see. The only true failure is giving up while you still have fight left in you.\n\nSorry for my tone",

Talk to people.\n\nI wanted to share a personal story about how I almost let BigIdeasDB go before it ever had a chance.\n\nI’ve built over 8 projects before this. Some shipped, some didn’t. Most flopped. At one point, I had started working on what eventually became BigIdeasDB, a platform that helps founders find real, validated problems to build around. I had the idea, started scraping Reddit posts, Upwork listings, G2 reviews… but I paused.\n\nBack then, I had a habit of stopping halfway. I’d build something, lose confidence when it didn’t immediately take off, and jump to the next thing. That almost happened with this one too.\n\nAt the time, I had a working prototype. I could generate startup ideas from Reddit threads, analyze SaaS gaps from reviews, and turn freelance gigs into product ideas. I even shared a small post or two, got decent engagement, some messages, but nothing crazy.\n\nI almost gave up again.\n\nBut something told me this time was different. So I kept going. I finished the MVP. I posted consistently. I asked for feedback. I improved it weekly based on what people actually wanted.\n\nNow BigIdeasDB has over 3,000 users and has made $16,000 in revenue.\n\nLooking back, I realize how many projects I gave up on just before they might have worked.\n\nThat’s why I’m sharing this.\nIf you’re building something, don’t stop halfway. Finish it. Talk to people. Share it. Iterate.\n\nIt probably won’t take off right away. But you’ll never know if you quit too early.",

    "chunk_text": "You’re overcomplicating it. Just solve a real problem. (Got my SaaS to $3,700 MRR) Most people know that the most common reason founders fail is because they don't achieve product–market fit. They build something that no one really wants.\n\nI built a few failed products too where I just couldn’t seem to get users. It’s a tricky situation to be in — you don’t know if you should keep building or just move on.\n\nWhat made Linkeddit different (my current SaaS) was how I started. I didn’t begin with a random idea. I started with a real problem I personally had.\n\n**Here’s what it was:**\n\nI wanted to find people who might be interested in my product — people talking about problems my product could solve. Reddit was full of those people. But finding them was super hard. I had to scroll through tons of posts, read every comment, and try to figure out who might be a good fit. It took forever, and I still wasn’t sure if I was even looking in the right places.\n\nThat’s when I realized: this is the problem.\n\nSo I built **Linkeddit** — a tool that searches Reddit for you. It finds users who are talking about the exact kind of problems your product solves. Then it gives you all the details — what they said, where they posted, how active they are — so you can reach out directly with context. No guessing. No wasted time.\n\nDon’t be afraid to niche down either. We started with tech and startup subreddits, and now we’re expanding to all kinds of communities — design, finance, marketing, etc. Every niche has people asking for tools, help, or advice.\n\nOnce you solve a real problem, things start to click.  \nPeople find you. They tell others. They actually want to pay. They stick around.\n\nThat was the goal with Linkeddit — to fix the exact thing that slowed me down when building. I had failed and succeeded before, and I knew what made the difference.\n\nFast forward a few months — we’re at 1500+ users and $5k+ MRR. Still growing. Still solving that same problem.\n\nWhen you solve a real problem:\n\n* Marketing is easier — you’re just explaining the problem and your solution\n* Users stick around because you’re helping them\n* You know exactly what to build next — they’ll tell you\n\nAnd you don’t feel lost anymore. You’re not wondering if people will care. You *know* they do.\n\nYou don’t need to change the world. You just need to fix something that frustrates people.\n\nThat’s what I did with Linkeddit.\n\nNow it’s helping others do the same.",

It’s getting harder every step, and we’ll likely pause client acquisition soon. I won’t promote or cite my solution. The story:\n\n\\- In my previous company, we needed to know when certain stores were opening, so we used a provider who manually analyzed news and sent us reports. It was helpful, but slow, expensive, and hard to scale.\n\n\\- After the rise of ChatGPT and LLM democratization, I started experimenting with automating that same use case. I fine-tuned a model trained on over 1 million articles to behave like our old provider. It worked surprisingly well.\n\n\\- Soon, people around me started asking for similar solutions. So I began offering it to my network.\n\n\\- The setup is pretty simple: we spend \\~30 minutes understanding the need, then (depending on complexity) we can deploy something in 1–10 days that delivers real-time alerts from any source, Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, and over 200 others.\n\n\\- There’s no UI, no dashboard, no SaaS. Just an API that delivers high-intent signals when it makes sense to engage. Alerts are sent to Slack, Hubspot, Salesforce, Whatsapp, Telegram, Email etC.\n\n\\- We charge between $200 and $2,000/month depending on scope. The average is around $700/month. It’s a monthly model, stop anytime, no commitment. Mainly because we can’t handle proper customer success at this scale.\n\n\\- We’re now near $70K MRR with 100 customers. But it’s getting harder. Ops, infra, support, it all adds up. We’ll probably pause new client acquisition soon to stay sane and focused.\n\nNot promoting anything, not sharing links, just sharing the story in case it’s helpful or interesting to anyone else building in this weird in-between space of product and services.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

How can we repurpose these generative representations for general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE (encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on our website.",

I show that transformer decoder LLMs can be made locally linear at inference time without changing outputs or weights.\n\n**Result**: LLMs can be converted into nearly exactly equivalent linear systems that reconstruct the next-token output for any given input text sequence. Instead of 25+ layers of nonlinear computations, this method computes a single set of matrix multiplications that linearly operates on the input embedding vectors and nearly exactly reconstructs the output embedding for a single token prediction.\n\n**Method**: A \"linear path\" through the transformer is identified, the nonlinear components are detached from the gradient, and the Jacobian with respect to the input embeddings is computed. This yields the \"detached Jacobian\", which is the set of matrices that operate linearly on input embeddings to reproduce the predicted output embedding with \\~10⁻⁶ error for float32 models.\n\n**Interpretability**: This method provides nearly-exact token attribution rather than approximate attention weights - tools from linear algebra like the SVD are used to understand which concepts drive predictions\n\n**Scope**: Works across Qwen 3, Gemma 3, Llama 3, Phi 4, Ministral and OLMo 2 (tested up to 70B parameters at q4).\n\n**Practical**: The method works on free Colab T4 instances for Gemma 3 4B and Llama 3.2 3B models.\n\n**Concept steering**: Preliminary results are shown for using the detached Jacobian as a linear conceptual steering operator in mid to late layers for guided generation of 8B models.\n\n**Trade-offs and costs**: The detached Jacobian linear system is only valid for that specific input sequence (and must be computed from scratch for each new sequence). This is slow (10 sec to compute the Jacobian for Llama 3.2 3B on a T4, up to minutes for models > 30B parameters), VRAM intensive and currently limited to very short sequences, but I plan to continue working on this aspect.\n\n**Applications**: In addition to steering, there is some potential for safety analysis (bias detection, deceptive content).\n\n**Background**: This extends prior work on [adaptive linear networks (Mohan, Khadkhodaie, Simoncelli et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05478) and [locally linear image diffusion models (Khadkhodaie, Simoncelli, et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02557) to transformer decoder architectures, building on [decoder circuit analysis (Elhage Nanda Olsson et al)](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html).\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWe demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Additionally, we present preliminary results on the detached Jacobian as a steering operator for inserting concepts into inference responses. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.",

Yet ReLU has remained popular for its simplicity and sparse activations despite the long-standing “dying ReLU” problem, where inactive neurons stop learning altogether.\n\nOur paper introduces **SUGAR** (Surrogate Gradient Learning for ReLU), a straightforward fix:\n\n* Forward pass: keep the standard ReLU.\n* Backward pass: replace its derivative with a smooth surrogate gradient.\n\nThis simple swap can be dropped into almost any network—including convolutional nets, transformers, and other modern architectures—without code-level surgery. With it, previously “dead” neurons receive meaningful gradients, improving convergence and generalization while preserving the familiar forward behaviour of ReLU networks.\n\n**Key results**\n\n* Consistent accuracy gains in convolutional networks by stabilising gradient flow—even for inactive neurons.\n* Competitive (and sometimes superior) performance compared with GELU-based models, while retaining the efficiency and sparsity of ReLU.\n* Smoother loss landscapes and faster, more stable training—all without architectural changes.\n\nWe believe this reframes ReLU not as a legacy choice but as a revitalised classic made relevant through careful gradient handling.

We achieved 2.634 for the sum of radii, which is 99.97% of DeepMind's reported 2.635!\n\nThe evolution was fascinating - early generations used geometric patterns, by gen 100 it switched to grid-based arrangements, and finally it discovered constrained optimization.\n\n### Function Minimization\nEvolved from a basic random search to a full simulated annealing algorithm, discovering concepts like temperature schedules and adaptive step sizes without being explicitly programmed with this knowledge.\n\n## LLM Performance Insights\n\nFor those running their own LLMs:\n- Low latency is critical since we need many generations\n- We found Cerebras AI's API gave us the fastest inference\n- For circle packing, an ensemble of Gemini-Flash-2.0 + Claude-Sonnet-3.7 worked best\n- The architecture allows you to use any model with an OpenAI-compatible API\n\n## Try it yourself!\n\nGitHub repo: [https://github.com/codelion/openevolve](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve)\n\nExamples:\n- [Circle Packing](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve/tree/main/examples/circle_packing)\n- [Function Minimization](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve/tree/main/examples/function_minimization)\n\nI'd love to see what you build with it and hear your feedback.

But not every token needs the same amount of reasoning. So I created a lightweight scoring mechanism that estimates how semantically dense a token is, and based on that, decides how many layers it should go through.\n\nIt’s called SparseDepthTransformer, and here’s what it does:\n\n* Scores each token for semantic importance\n* Skips deeper layers for less important tokens using hard gating\n* Tracks how many layers each token actually uses\n* Benchmarks against a baseline transformer\n\nIn my tests, this reduced memory usage by about 15% and cut the average number of layers per token by \\~40%, while keeping output quality the same.

    "chunk_text": "[R]Time Blindness: Why Video-Language Models Can't See What Humans Can? Found this paper pretty interesting. None of the models got anything right.\n\narxiv link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24867](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24867)\n\nAbstract:\n\nRecent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal patterns. We introduce SpookyBench, a benchmark where information is encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly, while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore, when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been made available on our project website: [https://timeblindness.github.io/](https://timeblindness.github.io/) .",

    "chunk_text": "[R] New ICML25 paper: Train and fine-tune large models faster than Adam while using only a fraction of the memory, with guarantees! A new paper at ICML25 that I worked on recently:\n\n>[Lean and Mean Adaptive Optimization via Subset-Norm and Subspace-Momentum with Convergence Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07120) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07120).\n\nExisting memory efficient optimizers like GaLore, LoRA, etc. often trade performance for memory saving for training large models. Our work aims to achieve the best of both worlds while providing rigorous theoretical guarantees: less memory, better performance (80% memory reduction while using only half the amount of tokens to achieve same performance as Adam for pre-training LLaMA 1B) and stronger theoretical guarantees than Adam and SoTA memory-efficient optimizers.\n\nCode is available at: [https://github.com/timmytonga/sn-sm](https://github.com/timmytonga/sn-sm)\n\nComments, feedbacks, or questions welcome!\n\nAbstract below:\n\n>We introduce two complementary techniques for efficient optimization that reduce memory requirements while accelerating training of large-scale neural networks. The first technique, Subset-Norm step size, generalizes AdaGrad-Norm and AdaGrad(-Coordinate) through step-size sharing. Subset-Norm (SN) reduces AdaGrad's memory footprint from O(d) to O(\\\\sqrt{d}), where d is the model size. For non-convex smooth objectives under coordinate-wise sub-gaussian noise, we show a noise-adapted high-probability convergence guarantee with improved dimensional dependence of SN over existing methods. Our second technique, Subspace-Momentum, reduces the momentum state's memory footprint by restricting momentum to a low-dimensional subspace while performing SGD in the orthogonal complement. We prove a high-probability convergence result for Subspace-Momentum under standard assumptions. Empirical evaluation on pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods. For instance, combining Subset-Norm with Subspace-Momentum achieves Adam's validation perplexity for LLaMA 1B in approximately half the training tokens (6.8B vs 13.1B) while reducing Adam's optimizer-states memory footprint by more than 80\\\\% with minimal additional hyperparameter tuning.",

This \"talk to users, discover pain\" advice is outdated bullshit from 2015.\n\nI did all the bullshit - targeted outreach to professionals in the industry, active participation in communities, 1:1 calls, industry events. Asked all the right questions. And know what?\n\nEvery significant workflow that could be improved by software ALREADY HAS a SaaS solution. Often several.

Sometimes even not the long run, literally save thousands with a single purchase, yet they still don’t use it - because dumb people are the problem. \n\nThe days of \"holy shit, they're using Excel for their entire inventory management\" are GONE. Everyone who could easily switch to a better tool has already done so. The low-hanging fruit has been picked clean.\n\nWhat I keep hearing instead:\n\n- \"Yeah we know there are better tools but we're locked into our current stack\"\n- \"Corporate would never approve another subscription\"  \n- \"Our team is split between old and new systems\"\n\n\nIt's not that people don't have pain - they absolutely do.

Stop waiting for word-of-mouth magic\n2. Discounting is a drug. Once you start, customers expect it. I've seen startups train their market to wait for discounts. Don't be a commodity\n3. Everyone is not your customer. The broader your target, the weaker your message. I spent 2 years trying to sell to all businesses and sold to almost none.\n4. Free trials kill urgency. Unless you have a strong onboarding process, free trials just delay the buying decision. I've seen 90%+ of free trials expire unused\n5. Features don't sell, outcomes do. Nobody cares about your advanced analytics. They care about making better decisions. Speak their language, not yours.\n6. Objections are buying signals. When someone says it's too expensive, they're telling you they want it but need justification. Don't run away, lean in.\n7. Your demo is probably too long. If you're demoing for more than 20 minutes, you're showing features, not solving problems. Keep it focused\n8. Referrals won't scale you. Referrals are amazing but inconsistent. Build a machine that doesn't depend on your customers' memory\n9. Most leads are garbage. I used to celebrate 100 leads/month. Then I tracked conversion and realized 95% were tire-kickers. Quality > quantity always\n10. You need a CRM from day one. Not for the fancy features. For the data. You can't improve what you don't measure. I regret not tracking sooner\n11. Founders must sell first. You can't outsource learning. Every founder needs to do at least 100 sales conversations before hiring anyone\n12. Pricing anxiety is normal. I was terrified to ask for money. Charged $29 when I should have charged $299. Your pricing reflects your confidence in the value.\n13. Follow-up is where deals happen. 80% of sales happen after the 5th touchpoint. Most founders give up after the first \"not interested.\" Persistence pays.\n14. Social proof trumps features. \"Company X increased revenue 40%\" sells better than any feature list. Collect and share customer wins religiously.\n15. Sales cycles are longer than you think. B2B sales take 3-6 months minimum. Plan your cash flow accordingly. I almost ran out of money waiting for sure thing deals.\n16. Gatekeepers aren't the enemy. Assistants and junior staff can be your biggest advocates. Treat everyone with respect, you never know who has influence.\n17. Most sales tools are shiny objects. You need: CRM, email, calendar, and phone. Everything else is distraction until you hit consistent revenue\n18. Sales is a numbers game, but not how you think. It's not about more calls. It's about better targeting, better qualification, and better process. Work smarter, not harder.\n\nSales gets easier when you genuinely believe your product makes customers' lives better. If you don't believe it, why should they?",

The insights we gathered could be valuable to other founders navigating similar issues.\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n* Revenue reached $74,223, slightly surpassing our April record despite expecting a drop after the tax season.\n* Organic traffic dropped 22%, primarily due to Google’s AI-generated search updates and seasonal changes post-tax season.\n* Encountered a significant Google Ads bug, causing a large influx of low-quality traffic from the Philippines and Indonesia, inflating our website visits and signups.\n* Interestingly, Google Ads outperformed organic search for customer acquisition—a first-time occurrence.\n* Launched our first YouTube video, diversifying channels amid uncertainty around Google’s evolving search strategy.\n* Approximately 10% of intro calls attributed their discovery of SavvyNomad to ChatGPT and other AI tools, indicating an emerging acquisition channel.\n\n**Detailed metrics:**\n\n* Signups: **2,063** (+50.1%)\n* Website Visits: **36,000** (+38.5%)\n* Visit → Signup Conversion Rate: **5.7%** (+7.5%)\n* Added MRR: **$6,542** (+1.0%)\n* Total MRR: **$38,252** (+20.4%)\n* Active Subscribers: **522** (+14.2%)\n* Churn Rate: **5.95%** (+35.8%)\n* ARPU: **$73.28** (+5.9%)\n\n**Challenges & opportunities:**\n\n* SEO: Continued investment in link building ($3,500/month) increased our Domain Rating from DR 25 to DR 35 despite a drop in organic traffic.\n* Google Ads: Discovered highly effective Performance Max campaigns targeting competitor website visitors (yes, you can do it), achieving an exceptionally low CAC (\\~$15 per subscription). Still managing the fallout from the traffic-quality bug.\n* YouTube: Released our first video after overcoming significant production delays. Our immediate goal is weekly high-quality uploads, experimenting with shorter formats, and exploring credibility improvements through speaker diversification.\n\nFeel free to ask questions or discuss any further points!\n\nP.S.:\n\nIf you're interested in more details, screenshots, and monthly reports, you can check out my full update here: [https://bohdandrozdov.me/p/may-2025-results](https://bohdandrozdov.me/p/may-2025-results)",

    "chunk_text": "The psychology behind SaaS pricing that most founders completely miss Been working with SaaS startups as a developer for years now, and holy shit the amount of founders who mess up their pricing is insane. They spend months perfecting features but like 20 minutes deciding how to price them.\n\nHere's some pricing psychology stuff that actually works but most founders completely ignore:\n\n**The anchoring effect is real af**\nWhen you show your expensive plan first, it makes everything else seem like a bargain. Had a client who was struggling with conversions until we reordered their pricing page to show the premium plan first. Suddenly their middle tier started selling like crazy. People saw the $199/mo plan and thought \"well $79 is a steal compared to that!\"\n\n**Freemium is usualy a trap**\nOne client had 10,000+ free users but only like 12 paying customers. Their free plan was way too generous. Another client ditched freemium entirely, switched to a 14-day trial and hit $25K MRR in under 6 months. The differnce? People actually had to make a decision instead of sitting in free-user purgatory forever.\n\n**The $9.99 thing actually works**\nYeah it seems stupid and everyone knows what your doing, but it still affects purchase decisions. Harvard Business School found that a 1% improvement in pricing can lead to an 11% increase in profit. We've tested this with multiple clients and charm pricing consistently outperforms round numbers.\n\n**Simpler is always better**\nIf your pricing page needs an FAQ section to explain it, you've already lost. Most users won't email to ask questions about your pricing - they'll just bounce. Keep it stupid simple: 2-3 plans max, clear names, bullet points.\n\n**Enterprise \"contact us\" pricing creates FOMO**\nThis is mind blowing but we saw it with 3 different clients - when you hide your top-tier pricing behind a \"contact us\" button, it creates weird FOMO for big customers. They imagine they're missing out on some special features. Enterprise leads literally tripled for one client after making this change.\n\n**Higher prices can increase demand (seriously)**\nZendesk actually RAISED prices for enterprise plans when they weren't selling, and suddenly demand went up. Enterprise buyers saw the lower price as a red flag - \"if it's cheap, it must not be good enough for us.\" Same product, higher price, more sales. Wild.\n\nI see so many founders pricing based on competitors or their costs instead of psychology. The data is clear tho - understanding how people perceive pricing matters way more than your actual costs.\n\nWhat pricing experiments have you guys tried? Anything that surprised you?",

Hardly a few real users in there.\n\nI checked my Supabase dashboard… and boom—over 100 new users signed up in a span of 10–15 minutes.  \nAll junk. All bots.\n\nAs a total beginner building my first SaaS, this was my \"welcome to the real world\" moment.  \nI had nothing in place to stop mass signups.  \nNo captcha. No rate limiting.  \nI just assumed I’d “add that stuff later” once I was in “real” launch mode.\n\nYeah, bad call.\n\nSo yesterday, I added Cloudflare Turnstile to both my signup and login forms.  \nIt’s working fine now.  \nIf I had known about Clerk earlier, I probably would’ve used that instead and saved myself the headache.  \nLesson: don’t try to handle auth and abuse protection yourself unless you know what you’re doing.\n\nThis was a small hit, but a good wake-up call.\n\nAnyway, just sharing my journey here.  \nToday I’m moving on to working on the landing page.  \nFingers crossed it goes smoother than this mess.\n\nIf you’re building your first SaaS too—don’t wait to add bot protection.

    "chunk_text": "After helping 15+ SaaS startups get their first customers here's what actually works (and what doesn't) Hey r/SaaS!\n\nSo I've been freelancing for about 4 years now, mostly helping early stage SaaS founders build their MVPs and figure out customer acquisition. I've seen some founders nail their first 10 customers in weeks, while others struggle for months with the same exact product. Thought I'd share what I've learned since a lot of you are asking about this stuff.\n\n**The stuff that actually works:**\n\n-  **Start with your network, seriously** - I know it sounds basic but every successful founder I've worked with got at least 3-4 of their first customers from people they already knew. Don't be weird about it tho, only reach out to people who actually have the problem you're solving\n\n-  **Cold email still works if you're not lazy** - But please stop sending \"Hi, I have a revolutionary solution...\" emails. Research the person, mention something specific about their company, and ask about their current process before pitching anything\n\n-  **Build ONE thing really well** - The founders who succeed focus on solving one specific problem perfectly. The ones who fail try to build everything at once. I've literally seen startups with 50+ features get beaten by apps that do ONE thing amazingly\n\n-  **Price it right from day 1** - Don't give your product away for free hoping people will upgrade later. If someone won't pay $30/month for something that saves them 10 hours, they probably don't have a real problem. Start at like 80% of competitor pricing max\n\n-  **Join communities where your customers hang out** - But don't spam! I've seen founders get their first customers just by being helpful in Slack groups and LinkedIn communities for months before ever mentioning their product\n\n**What doesn't work (learned this the hard way):**\n\n-  Social media ads for early customers - waste of money unless you have serious budget\n-  Building features before talking to customers - obvious but somehow everyone does this\n-  Focusing on competitors instead of customers\n-  Perfectionism - your MVP doesn't need to look like Notion lol\n\n**The biggest mistake I see:** Founders thinking they need to scale marketing before they even know if people want their product. Like, worry about Facebook ads when you have 100 customers, not when you have zero.\n\nOne more thing - if you can't get 10 people to pay for your SaaS within 3 months of launching, you probably don't have product-market fit yet. Don't keep building features, go talk to more customers.\n\nBeen working on a few projects lately where founders finally \"got it\" and went from 0 to 15 customers in 6 weeks after struggling for months. It's usually about focus and actually talking to people, not the tech stack or fancy features.\n\nAnyone else been through this grind? What worked for you?",

    "chunk_text": "Your SaaS isn't dying because of churn. It's dying because you're selling to broke people. Everyone obsesses over churn rates. Our churn is 8%! We need to get it down to 3%!\n\nBut here's what I see at every struggling SaaS I work with: they're not losing customers because their product sucks. They're losing customers because their customers can't afford to keep paying\n\nYou're selling $50/month software to freelancers who make $1000/month. You're selling $200/month tools to startups burning through their last $10k. You're selling enterprise features to companies that should be using spreadsheets.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth low churn doesn't matter if your customers are fundamentally unable to pay long-term\n\nI've watched companies celebrate 2% monthly churn while their customers are literally going out of business. Meanwhile, companies selling $500/month to profitable businesses barely worry about churn because their customers make money using the product\n\nWhat actually matters \n\n\\- can your customer make/save more money using your product than they pay you?\n\n\\- Are they profitable enough that your fee is noise, not a burden?\n\n\\- Do they have a budget specifically for tools like yours?\n\nThe pattern I see everywhere struggling saas sells cheap to cash-poor customers, fights churn constantly and thriving saas sells expensive to cash-rich customers, churn becomes irrelevant\n\nStop trying to make broke people less broke. Start finding people who already have money and help them make more of it.\n\nYour churn problem isn't a product problem. It's a customer selection problem\n\n  \nHope it helps",

It took me 7 months of different ideas, marketing methods, product changes, and working my ass off just to get my first paying customer.\n\nThat’s 7 months of effort for $20.\n\nIt was incredibly hard to reach that point, and it was the greatest feeling in the world.\n\nBut once you go from 0 → 1, something changes.\n\n1 month after getting my first paying customer, I hit $1,300.\n\n3 months after, $4,500\n\n6 months after, $16,500\n\n8 months after, $33,000\n\nIn the beginning you have to fight for those first users and paying customers.\n\nThe market is crowded, competitive, and you have no social proof or following. Getting your message through all this noise is not easy.\n\nBut eventually someone gives your product a shot. One user grows to a few, you get a little bit of social proof for your product, and it becomes easier for new people to try it.\n\nIf you serve your first customers well, listen to their feedback, and help them solve their problems, they will begin recommending you to others.\n\nAnd just like that, real growth begins.\n\nYou also know your target audience better now, which marketing channels worked, and where you should double down.\n\nIt gets easier.\n\nMy “game plan” was simple:\n\n1. I kept taking daily action even when I was met with silence, no new signups, and rejections in DMs.\n2. At the end of each day, I looked back on what I had done and wrote down one thing I would improve the next day.\n3. Then I implemented the improvement, and kept going.\n\nIf you’re in the 0 → 1 phase right now, you just have to keep going.\n\nI know that it’s hard right now. It’s the hardest part, and I say that from my own experience.\n\nAnd I can also say that if you don’t quit, you get to see the other side of it.\n\n([$33k revenue image](https://imgur.com/a/0aDJOG4) \\+ [video](https://screen.studio/share/2hblTGFE) since it's Reddit 😅)\n\nEdit - here's my [SaaS](https://buildpad.io) since people are asking",

Instead, they suggest our universe formed *inside* a massive black hole. According to this theory, matter within a collapsing cloud reached a high-density state, but instead of collapsing into an infinite singularity, it \"bounced back like a compressed spring\" due to stored energy, creating our universe.\n\nKey aspects and implications of this \"Black Hole Universe\" theory include:\n\n* It suggests the universe's origin is not from nothing, but the continuation of a cosmic cycle.\n* The edge of our observable universe might be the event horizon of a larger \"parent\" black hole, implying other black holes could contain their own unseen universes, potentially connected by \"wormholes.\"\n* It relies on quantum physics setting fundamental limits on how much matter can be compressed, preventing the infinite singularity predicted by classical physics, and thus allowing for the \"bounce.\"\n* This new model may help explain various cosmic mysteries, such as the anomaly of galaxies' rotation, the origin of supermassive black holes, the nature of dark matter, and the formation and evolution of galaxies.\n\nThe research was published in the journal *Physical Review D*.",

After burning through $150 in cloud costs, I had a weird thought: what if I encoded my documents into video frames?\n\nThe idea sounds absurd - why would you store text in video? But modern video codecs have spent decades optimizing for compression. So I tried converting text into QR codes, then encoding those as video frames, letting H.264/H.265 handle the compression magic.\n\nThe results surprised me. 10,000 PDFs compressed down to a 1.4GB video file. Search latency came in around 900ms compared to Pinecone’s 820ms, so about 10% slower. But RAM usage dropped from 8GB+ to just 200MB, and it works completely offline with no API keys or monthly bills.\n\nThe technical approach is simple: each document chunk gets encoded into QR codes which become video frames. Video compression handles redundancy between similar documents remarkably well. Search works by decoding relevant frame ranges based on a lightweight index.\n\nYou get a vector database that’s just a video file you can copy anywhere.",

In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration.  We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.\"\n\nOne part that resonated with me greatly was regarding the human developer.  \"I will toil in this cave and no one will know this code exists until it is perfect,  at which point I will emerge and be recognized for the genius I am.\"   On reddit,  have you ever done some quick research before clicking that \"post\" button,  out of concern you may be wrong or fearful of backlash?  Same concept.\n\nThe consequence of this (among others) is that neither your team nor the newer generation of programmers will get to see all of the failure you had to endure, to achieve that one cool thing,  because of the way we want to be viewed.  Enduring those failures and overcoming them,  I believe,  is more important then, and required by, any programming language, framework, tool, etc.\n\nNewcomers have all the resources, AI, and work previous generations have accomplished to look up to but we are doing those people a disservice by hiding our failures due to human emotion wether thats how we want to be viewed or general fear of negative feedback from our work.\n\nHopefully this doesn't offend anyone or become divisive,  it's just some unspoken honesty that I have appreciation for and it stuck with me because honestly... it hit close to home when I saw it back then.",

It took me quite some time to decide to move to fullstack web since I felt for a long time that web dev was like pounding a square peg through a round hole (and it still feels like that in some aspects), but the JS eco-system is fantastic these days. And JS truly runs everywhere.\n\nSomething that's always amazed me is how some people like to spend their energy on bashing the new stuff that comes along. And it's always about focusing and exaggerating the negative sides. It has reached a point where I'm compelled to give new tech extra attention if it's heavily criticized by other programmers.\nBack in the day those who programmed Visual Basic where \"script kiddies\" and when React and Node came out it received tons of negative opinion only to dominate a few years later.\n \nSo on this note I've lately focused on using AI as much as possible when programming. And I think it's bloody fantastic if used right. And by right I mean to let it do small well defined tasks and integrate into your app. Not prompt it to build an entire app so that you don't understand and can maintain the code.\n\nEspecially CSS/Tailwind which I hate passionately. Just give the layout you want to the AI and let it grind until it looks right.\n\nI get that it can be tempting for new programmers to copy paste AI generated code they don't understand into a project, which is not a good idea.

A little advice to developers who are starting out from a software architect with 15 years experience and a 2:1 Computer Science degree. \n\nToday was the first time I've ever seen Leetcode whilst I was watching a few YouTube videos about some updates to C# (My language of choice). For me, Leetcode is definitely not reflective at all of what you would do in the majority of programming jobs and is very algorithmically heavy. Most of these algorithms you will not need to know at all most of the time as most languages contain core libraries that do this stuff way more efficiently than most developers will be able to do. \n\nCase in point, I was stuck on the first question today for about 45 minutes mainly because the question was worded really badly. I managed to solve that pretty quickly after I understood what it was asking for although I will admit I did it in my IDE rather than in Leetcode as nobody codes in the equivalent of Notepad anymore (although that's how I started back in the day). \n\nThe second question I was completely stumped and gave up because it was more maths than programming (and believe it or not, you do not need to be good at maths to be a good developer). It's really going to depend on what you end up doing as an actual job. \n\nIf you are writing drivers or doing anything mathematically heavy in your job then yes Leetcode might be a good fit but mostly it's algorithmic nonsense that most developers will never even use. I've worked for some of the biggest banks, insurance providers doing APIs hooking up to some pretty complex business logic and never have I had to use anything close to Leetcode level solutions. \n\nMy point is, don't be disappointed in yourself if you struggle with Leetcode. You can still be a success. Lead teams. Produce mobile applications and desktop systems that millions of users use and enjoy each year all without ever needing to worry about the types or problems shown on Leetcode.",

Well, I'm not sure where to start explaining this, but ever since I first learned about the Stanford Bunny while studying computer graphics, I've been steadily (though not obsessively) tracking down the same rabbit that Dr. Greg Turk originally purchased for the past 7 years.   \n  \nThe process was so long and that I probably can't write it all here, and I'm planning to make a YouTube video soon about all the ~~rabbit holes~~ pitfalls and journeys I went through to get my hands on this bunny. though since English isn't my native language, I'm not sure when that will happen.   \n  \nTo summarize briefly: this is a ceramic rabbit from the same mold as Stanford bunny, but unfortunately it's likely not produced from the same place where Dr. Greg Turk bought his. Obviously, the ultimate goal is to find the original terracotta one or slip mold for it, but just finding this with the same shape was absolutely brutal (there are tons of similar knockoffs, and just imagine searching for 'terracotta rabbit' on eBay). So I'm incredibly happy just to see it in person, and I wanted to share this surreal sight with all of you. \n\nFor now, I'm thinking about making a Cornell box for it with some plywood I have left at home. Lastly, if there's anyone else out there like me who's searching for the actual Stanford Bunny, I'm open to collaborating, though I probably can't be super intensive about it.

    "chunk_text": "Relational vs Document-Oriented Database for System Design This is the repo with the full examples: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/relational-db-vs-document-store\n\n# Relational vs Document-Oriented Database for Software Architecture\n\nWhat I go through in here is:\n\n1. Super quick refresher of what these two are\n2. Key differences\n3. Strengths and weaknesses\n4. System design examples (+ Spring Java code)\n5. Brief history\n\nIn the examples, I choose a relational DB in the first, and a document-oriented DB in the other. The focus is on _why_ did I make that choice. I also provide some example code for both.\n\nIn the strengths and weaknesses part, I discuss both what _used to be a strength/weakness_ and how it looks nowadays.\n\n## Super short summary\n\nThe two most common types of DBs are:\n\n- **Relational database (RDB)**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle DB, ...\n- **Document-oriented database (document store):** MongoDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB...\n\n### RDB\n\nThe key idea is: **fit the data into a big table**. The columns are _properties_ and the rows are the _values_. By doing this, we have our data in a very structured way. So we have much power for querying the data (using SQL). That is, we can do all sorts of filters, joints etc. The _way_ we arrange the data into the table is called the _database schema_.\n\n#### Example table\n\n```\n+----+---------+---------------------+-----+\n| ID | Name    | Email               | Age |\n+----+---------+---------------------+-----+\n| 1  | Alice   | alice@example.com   | 30  |\n| 2  | Bob     | bob@example.com     | 25  |\n| 3  | Charlie | charlie@example.com | 28  |\n+----+---------+---------------------+-----+\n```\n\nA database can have many tables.\n\n### Document stores\n\nThe key idea is: **just store the data as it is**. Suppose we have an object. We just convert it to a JSON and store it as it is. We call this data a _document_. It's not limited to JSON though, it can also be BSON (binary JSON) or XML for example.\n\n#### Example document\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"user_id\": 123,\n  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n  \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\n  \"orders\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"item\": \"Book\", \"price\": 12.99},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"item\": \"Pen\", \"price\": 1.50}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEach document is saved under a unique ID. This ID can be a path, for example in Google Cloud Firestore, but doesn't have to be.\n\nMany documents _'in the same bucket'_ is called a _collection_. We can have many collections.\n\n## Differences\n\n#### Schema\n\n- RDBs have a fixed schema. Every row _'has the same schema'_.\n- Document stores don't have schemas. Each document can _'have a different schema'_.\n\n#### Data Structure\n\n- RDBs break data into normalized tables with relationships through foreign keys\n- Document stores nest related data directly within documents as embedded objects or arrays\n\n#### Query Language\n\n- RDBs use SQL, a standardized declarative language\n- Document stores typically have their own query APIs\n  - Nowadays, the common document stores support SQL-like queries too\n\n#### Scaling Approach\n\n- RDBs traditionally scale vertically (bigger/better machines)\n  - Nowadays, the most common RDBs offer horizontal scaling as well (eg. PostgeSQL)\n- Document stores are great for horizontal scaling (more machines)\n\n#### Transaction Support\n\nACID = availability, consistency, isolation, durability\n\n- RDBs have mature ACID transaction support\n- Document stores traditionally sacrificed ACID guarantees in favor of performance and availability\n  - The most common document stores nowadays support ACID though (eg. MongoDB)\n\n## Strengths, weaknesses\n\n### Relational Databases\n\nI want to repeat a few things here again that have changed. As noted, nowadays, most document stores support SQL and ACID. Likewise, most RDBs nowadays support horizontal scaling.\n\nHowever, let's look at ACID for example. While document stores support it, it's much more mature in RDBs. So if your app puts super high relevance on ACID, then probably RDBs are better. But if your app just needs basic ACID, both works well and this shouldn't be the deciding factor.\n\nFor this reason, I have put these points, that are supported in both, in **parentheses**.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Data Integrity**: Strong schema enforcement ensures data consistency\n- (**Complex Querying**: Great for complex joins and aggregations across multiple tables)\n- (**ACID**)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- **Schema**: While the schema was listed as a strength, it also is a weakness. Changing the schema requires migrations which can be painful\n- **Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch**: Translating between application objects and relational tables adds complexity. Hibernate and other Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks help though.\n- (**Horizontal Scaling**: Supported but sharding is more complex as compared to document stores)\n- **Initial Dev Speed**: Setting up schemas etc takes some time\n\n### Document-Oriented Databases\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Schema Flexibility**: Better for heterogeneous data structures\n- **Throughput:** Supports high throughput, especially write throughput\n- (**Horizontal Scaling**: Horizontal scaling is easier, you can shard document-wise (document 1-1000 on computer A and 1000-2000 on computer B))\n- **Performance for Document-Based Access**: Retrieving or updating an entire document is very efficient\n- **One-to-Many Relationships**: Superior in this regard. You don't need joins or other operations.\n- **Locality**: See below\n- **Initial Dev Speed**: Getting started is quicker due to the flexibility\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- **Complex Relationships**: Many-to-one and many-to-many relationships are difficult and often require denormalization or application-level joins\n- **Data Consistency**: More responsibility falls on application code to maintain data integrity\n- **Query Optimization**: Less mature optimization engines compared to relational systems\n- **Storage Efficiency**: Potential data duplication increases storage requirements\n- **Locality**: See below\n\n### Locality\n\nI have listed locality as a strength and a weakness of document stores. Here is what I mean with this.\n\nIn document stores, cocuments are typically stored as a single, continuous string, encoded in formats like JSON, XML, or binary variants such as MongoDB's BSON. This structure provides a locality advantage when applications need to access entire documents. Storing related data together minimizes disk seeks, unlike relational databases (RDBs) where data split across multiple tables - this requires multiple index lookups, increasing retrieval time.\n\nHowever, it's only a benefit when we need (almost) the entire document at once. Document stores typically load the entire document, even if only a small part is accessed. This is inefficient for large documents. Similarly, updates often require rewriting the entire document. So to keep these downsides small, make sure your documents are small.\n\nLast note: Locality isn't exclusive to document stores. For example Google Spanner or Oracle achieve a similar locality in a relational model.\n\n## System Design Examples\n\nNote that I limit the examples to the minimum so the article is not totally bloated. The code is incomplete on purpose. You can find the complete code in the examples folder of the repo.\n\nThe examples folder contains two complete applications:\n\n1. `financial-transaction-system` - A Spring Boot and React application using a relational database (H2)\n2. `content-management-system` - A Spring Boot and React application using a document-oriented database (MongoDB)\n\nEach example has its own README file with instructions for running the applications.\n\n## Example 1: Financial Transaction System\n\n### Requirements\n\n#### Functional requirements\n\n- Process payments and transfers\n- Maintain accurate account balances\n- Store audit trails for all operations\n\n#### Non-functional requirements\n\n- Reliability (!!)\n- Data consistency (!!)\n\n#### Why Relational is Better Here\n\nWe want reliability and data consistency. Though document stores support this too (ACID for example), they are less mature in this regard. The benefits of document stores are not interesting for us, so we go with an RDB.\n\nNote: If we would expand this example and add things like _profiles of sellers_, _ratings_ and more, we might want to add a separate DB where we have different priorities such as availability and high throughput. With two separate DBs we can support different requirements and scale them independently.\n\n### Data Model\n\n```\nAccounts:\n- account_id (PK = Primary Key)\n- customer_id (FK = Foreign Key)\n- account_type\n- balance\n- created_at\n- status\n\nTransactions:\n- transaction_id (PK)\n- from_account_id (FK)\n- to_account_id (FK)\n- amount\n- type\n- status\n- created_at\n- reference_number\n```\n\n### Spring Boot Implementation\n\n```java\n// Entity classes\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"accounts\")\npublic class Account {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long accountId;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private Long customerId;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String accountType;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private BigDecimal balance;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private LocalDateTime createdAt;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String status;\n\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"transactions\")\npublic class Transaction {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long transactionId;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"from_account_id\")\n    private Account fromAccount;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"to_account_id\")\n    private Account toAccount;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private BigDecimal amount;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String type;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String status;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private LocalDateTime createdAt;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String referenceNumber;\n\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n\n// Repository\npublic interface TransactionRepository extends JpaRepository<Transaction, Long> {\n    List<Transaction> findByFromAccountAccountIdOrToAccountAccountId(Long accountId, Long sameAccountId);\n    List<Transaction> findByCreatedAtBetween(LocalDateTime start, LocalDateTime end);\n}\n\n// Service with transaction support\n@Service\npublic class TransferService {\n    private final AccountRepository accountRepository;\n    private final TransactionRepository transactionRepository;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public TransferService(AccountRepository accountRepository, TransactionRepository transactionRepository) {\n        this.accountRepository = accountRepository;\n        this.transactionRepository = transactionRepository;\n    }\n\n    @Transactional\n    public Transaction transferFunds(Long fromAccountId, Long toAccountId, BigDecimal amount) {\n        Account fromAccount = accountRepository.findById(fromAccountId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new AccountNotFoundException(\"Source account not found\"));\n\n        Account toAccount = accountRepository.findById(toAccountId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new AccountNotFoundException(\"Destination account not found\"));\n\n        if (fromAccount.getBalance().compareTo(amount) < 0) {\n            throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds in source account\");\n        }\n\n        // Update balances\n        fromAccount.setBalance(fromAccount.getBalance().subtract(amount));\n        toAccount.setBalance(toAccount.getBalance().add(amount));\n\n        accountRepository.save(fromAccount);\n        accountRepository.save(toAccount);\n\n        // Create transaction record\n        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();\n        transaction.setFromAccount(fromAccount);\n        transaction.setToAccount(toAccount);\n        transaction.setAmount(amount);\n        transaction.setType(\"TRANSFER\");\n        transaction.setStatus(\"COMPLETED\");\n        transaction.setCreatedAt(LocalDateTime.now());\n        transaction.setReferenceNumber(generateReferenceNumber());\n\n        return transactionRepository.save(transaction);\n    }\n\n    private String generateReferenceNumber() {\n        return \"TXN\" + System.currentTimeMillis();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## System Design Example 2: Content Management System\n\nA content management system.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Store various content types, including articles and products\n- Allow adding new content types\n- Support comments\n\n### Non-functional requirements\n\n- Performance\n- Availability\n- Elasticity\n\n### Why Document Store is Better Here\n\nAs we have no critical transaction like in the previous example but are only interested in performance, availability and elasticity, document stores are a great choice. Considering that various content types is a requirement, our life is easier with document stores as they are schema-less.\n\n### Data Model\n\n```json\n// Article document\n{\n  \"id\": \"article123\",\n  \"type\": \"article\",\n  \"title\": \"Understanding NoSQL\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"id\": \"user456\",\n    \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"jane@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"content\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\",\n  \"tags\": [\"database\", \"nosql\", \"tutorial\"],\n  \"published\": true,\n  \"publishedDate\": \"2025-05-01T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"comments\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"comment789\",\n      \"userId\": \"user101\",\n      \"userName\": \"Bob Johnson\",\n      \"text\": \"Great article!\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2025-05-02T14:20:00Z\",\n      \"replies\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"reply456\",\n          \"userId\": \"user456\",\n          \"userName\": \"Jane Smith\",\n          \"text\": \"Thanks Bob!\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2025-05-02T15:45:00Z\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"viewCount\": 1250,\n    \"likeCount\": 42,\n    \"featuredImage\": \"/images/nosql-header.jpg\",\n    \"estimatedReadTime\": 8\n  }\n}\n\n// Product document (completely different structure)\n{\n  \"id\": \"product789\",\n  \"type\": \"product\",\n  \"name\": \"Premium Ergonomic Chair\",\n  \"price\": 299.99,\n  \"categories\": [\"furniture\", \"office\", \"ergonomic\"],\n  \"variants\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"black\",\n      \"sku\": \"EC-BLK-001\",\n      \"inStock\": 23\n    },\n    {\n      \"color\": \"gray\",\n      \"sku\": \"EC-GRY-001\",\n      \"inStock\": 14\n    }\n  ],\n  \"specifications\": {\n    \"weight\": \"15kg\",\n    \"dimensions\": \"65x70x120cm\",\n    \"material\": \"Mesh and aluminum\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Spring Boot Implementation with MongoDB\n\n```java\n@Document(collection = \"content\")\npublic class ContentItem {\n    @Id\n    private String id;\n    private String type;\n    private Map<String, Object> data;\n\n    // Common fields can be explicit\n    private boolean published;\n    private Date createdAt;\n    private Date updatedAt;\n\n    // The rest can be dynamic\n    @DBRef(lazy = true)\n    private User author;\n\n    private List<Comment> comments;\n\n    // Basic getters and setters\n}\n\n// MongoDB Repository\npublic interface ContentRepository extends MongoRepository<ContentItem, String> {\n    List<ContentItem> findByType(String type);\n    List<ContentItem> findByTypeAndPublishedTrue(String type);\n    List<ContentItem> findByData_TagsContaining(String tag);\n}\n\n// Service for content management\n@Service\npublic class ContentService {\n    private final ContentRepository contentRepository;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public ContentService(ContentRepository contentRepository) {\n        this.contentRepository = contentRepository;\n    }\n\n    public ContentItem createContent(String type, Map<String, Object> data, User author) {\n        ContentItem content = new ContentItem();\n        content.setType(type);\n        content.setData(data);\n        content.setAuthor(author);\n        content.setCreatedAt(new Date());\n        content.setUpdatedAt(new Date());\n        content.setPublished(false);\n\n        return contentRepository.save(content);\n    }\n\n    public ContentItem addComment(String contentId, Comment comment) {\n        ContentItem content = contentRepository.findById(contentId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new ContentNotFoundException(\"Content not found\"));\n\n        if (content.getComments() == null) {\n            content.setComments(new ArrayList<>());\n        }\n\n        content.getComments().add(comment);\n        content.setUpdatedAt(new Date());\n\n        return contentRepository.save(content);\n    }\n\n    // Easily add new fields without migrations\n    public ContentItem addMetadata(String contentId, String key, Object value) {\n        ContentItem content = contentRepository.findById(contentId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new ContentNotFoundException(\"Content not found\"));\n\n        Map<String, Object> data = content.getData();\n        if (data == null) {\n            data = new HashMap<>();\n        }\n\n        // Just update the field, no schema changes needed\n        data.put(key, value);\n        content.setData(data);\n\n        return contentRepository.save(content);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Brief History of RDBs vs NoSQL\n\n- Edgar Codd published a paper in 1970 proposing RDBs\n- RDBs became the leader of DBs, mainly due to their reliability\n- NoSQL emerged around 2009, companies like Facebook & Google developed custom solutions to handle their unprecedented scale. They published papers on their internal database systems, inspiring open-source alternatives like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n\n  - The term itself came from a Twitter hashtag actually\n\nThe main reasons for a _'NoSQL wish'_ were:\n\n- Need for horizontal scalability\n- More flexible data models\n- Performance optimization\n- Lower operational costs\n\nHowever, as mentioned already, nowadays RDBs support these things as well, so the clear distinctions between RDBs and document stores are becoming more and more blurry. Most modern databases incorporate features from both.",

    "chunk_text": "PCP Theorem Question From my understanding the PCP theorem says that determining whether a CSP has a satisfying assignment or whether all assignments violate at least percentage gamma of the clauses remains NP-complete, or equivalently, that you can verify a correct NP proof (w/ 100% certainty) and reject an incorrect proof (with some probability) by using a constant number of random bits. I'm basically confused about what's inside the gap. Does this imply that an assignment that violates (say) percentage gamma/2 of the clauses is an NP witness. It seems like yes because such an assignment should be NP-complete to find. If so, how would you verify such a proof with 100% accuracy because what if one of the randomly checked clauses is one of the violated clauses. Would finding such an assignment guarantee that there is a satisfying assignment (because it's not the case that no assignment violates less than gamma clauses). I'm confident I must be misunderstanding something but I can’t tell what exactly and any discussion would be appreciated. Thanks!",

I occasionally need to revise documents; PDFs, older OpenOffice files, the odd résumé template, and I’m on Windows 10. Last time I got stuck, my partner used Apple Pages on her Mac to clean up the formatting in minutes. Now I’m hoping there’s a comparable, straightforward editor for Windows. Something lightweight, preferably free, and able to open a mix of .docx, .odt, and even annotate PDFs without wrestling with a huge learning curve.\n\nA colleague mentioned WPS Office as a Pages-like option on Windows. If you’ve used it, does the interface feel as intuitive as Pages, and how well does it handle PDFs or legacy OpenOffice documents? If not WPS, is there anything built-in to Windows that comes close?",

This is a timing attack, it actually blew my mind when I first learned about it.\n\nSo here's an example of a vulnerable endpoint (image below), if you haven't heard of this attack try to guess what's wrong here (\"TIMING attack\" might be a hint lol).\n\nSo the problem is that in javascript, === is not designed to perform constant-time operations, meaning that comparing 2 string where the 1st characters don't match will be faster than comparing 2 string where the 10th characters don't match.\"qwerty\" === \"awerty\" is a bit faster than\"qwerty\" === \"qwerta\"\n\nThis means that an attacker can technically brute-force his way into your application, supplying this endpoint with different keys and checking the time it takes for each to complete.\n\nHow to prevent this? Use crypto.timingSafeEqual(req.body.apiKey, SECRET\\_API\\_KEY) which doesn't give away the time it takes to complete the comparison.\n\nNow, in the real world random network delays and rate limiting make this attack basically fucking impossible to pull off, but it's a nice little thing to know i guess 🤷‍♂️",

    "chunk_text": "We built something similar to Apple's Liquid Glass for the web 9 years ago. Here's why we don't recommend this design https://preview.redd.it/1ta01vr6o36f1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ae34dbbeef1b5ad66927118460d396764a77e08\n\nIn 2016, our team at Akveo launched an open-source dashboard template called **Blur Admin**, inspired by Iron Man’s UI and packed with heavy background blur effects. Think “Liquid Glass,” years before Apple’s recent announcement.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2estpjj7o36f1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0241f8e96c419ed28deea07048e5cfb4dbd1f5c\n\nWe shared it on Reddit, went to sleep, and woke up to internet fame. Blur Admin hit the front page of Product Hunt and brought in tons of inbound requests. But as we started integrating it into real-world projects, the problems became impossible to ignore:\n\n* **Unreadable text**: Blurring doesn’t work well with gradients or images — the contrast becomes unpredictable and breaks accessibility\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i13keda9o36f1.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12ba0b2711ba49531986b70112f8c8ea475744f\n\n* **Poor contrast**: WCAG contrast ratios are tough to maintain over dynamic backgrounds. Hint text, placeholders, even buttons disappeared.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l85in9dao36f1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=4172280dc95727f89236f5b9673b356594a7aacb\n\n* **Context loss**: Blur effects made it harder for users to focus or orient themselves on the page — especially for those with cognitive or visual impairments\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m47cavwco36f1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b96002c50b96d6c7e66cc01f90ce9910c715154\n\n* **Motion sensitivity**: Animating blur transitions created motion issues — eye strain, dizziness, and poor performance.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf319tmeo36f1.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=1668bbc4482c21ba672cff310818430443e1c59e\n\n* **Broken visual cues**: Borders and focus states got lost behind the blur — frustrating keyboard and accessibility users.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2uwzrpofo36f1.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=61aff72cfa69bd5c74ed4b3774a4ae08cd7dceec\n\nAnd those were just the design issues. On the implementation side, we discovered limited browser support, forcing us to use suboptimal workarounds. Over time, WebKit introduced the backdrop-filter CSS property, but it's still a performance killer - browsers have to recalculate the blur on every scroll. Maybe Apple has optimized this across their devices, but I strongly advise anyone building a Liquid Glass design on platforms other than Apple to thoroughly test performance.\n\nWe eventually sunset this open source project, but you can still check it out here: [https://bluradmin.z19.web.core.windows.net/#/dashboard](https://bluradmin.z19.web.core.windows.net/#/dashboard)\n\nI wonder if the Apple Design team is aware of all these issues and whether they’ve developed solutions. Time will tell, but so far, it looks like they’ve repeated many of the same mistakes we made.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share our learnings!",

It seems like a refresh that’s kind of underwhelming, but it’s a ton of programming to get this to work.  You can’t do this in CSS without on device material rendering.  \n\nWill you use the CSS described in the vercel app to update your design aesthetic?  I know I will.  It may not be “Liquid Glass” but it is cool.",

I held it private, as NSFW content is a bit controversial. But as it only shows content from Reddit itself, wouldn't Reddit be controversial itself? Reddit contains a vast amount of adult content. It's not a secret. However I didn't like the interface of the Reddit website (don't get me started on their mobile app), so I made my own client for that. \n\nNow, three years later, I decided to make it open-source. That means that it was open-sourced before, too, but the repo was just private. \n\nHere are some very important aspects that you should be aware of:\n\n* It uses Reddit's OAuth API (since the controversial API policy change 2 years ago)\n* It uses hotlinking only! No media is downloaded and stored\n* It uses a curated approach, means the subreddits are stored in a database\n* The repo itself doesn't contain any subs, you'll have to add them yourself\n* I'm not going to work on the project anymore, but it may be useful for one or the other\n\nThat said, what are the features?\n\n* ❇️ Browse curated Subreddits\n* 🎚️ Sort by hot, top and new\n* 👄 Show user postings\n* 👤 Display single posts\n* 📄 Display useful infos about a post\n* 🎞️ Video section\n* 🔥 Trending creators\n* 💚 Featured creators\n* 🔖 Favorites\n* 🐤 Twitter bot\n* 📈 Statistics\n* 🔑 Toggable authentication feature\n* 📱 Responsive layout\n* 📜 Cronjobs\n\nThe installation can be a bit of a hassle, but here is the general approach:\n\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Create a .env from the .env.example\n3. Set up your database and oauth settings in the .env\n4. Run \"composer install\"\n5. Add an [initial entry](https://pastebin.com/SRdZaBpM) in the AppSettingsModel table \n6. Add your NSFW related [subreddits](https://rentry.co/p38anup2)\n7. Launch the app via \"php asatru serve\"\n\nThe project requires PHP \\^8.2 and MariaDB.\n\n**Here is some related media of the project:**\n\nIndex page: [https://i.imgur.com/fcWrwx7.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/fcWrwx7.jpeg) \n\nSubreddit view: [https://i.imgur.com/Jlk3MSk.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/Jlk3MSk.jpeg) \n\nVisitor statistics: [https://i.imgur.com/bqaXZnn.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/bqaXZnn.jpeg) \n\nSimilarweb ranking: [https://i.imgur.com/x6j56k2.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/x6j56k2.jpeg) \n\nGoogle Search Milestone: [https://i.imgur.com/7jP8NmT.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/7jP8NmT.jpeg) \n\n**Link to repository:**\n\n[https://github.com/danielbrendel/redhotsubs](https://github.com/danielbrendel/redhotsubs)",

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the game is *complete* shit, I am proud of the concept, I think the final product is okay, but part of me still fucking hates it. After release, and taking a step back, I realised that the game itself ended up being really stupid, pretty mediocre and the whole process of making it wasn’t worth any of the mental anguish.\n\nI wasted so much time dedicating all of my energy onto this project that it ruined me. I could have been using my time working a full-time job instead too, especially since my family is on the poorer side. For context, I’m 20. I kind of used indie game development as a form of escapism from my irl situation — now I realize that was incredibly stupid and pointless.\n\nI do enjoy the actual process of game development, hence why I spent my time doing it. I have a passion to create. I did all of the programming, drew all of the art, etc. but I also wanted to actually release the game on Steam too, and I didn’t want it to flop.\n\nSo I tried hiring a marketing agency to help me… I spent $3,000 (now I realize is the stupidest thing I’ve ever spent my money on) on a marketing campaign for the game, only for it to get minimal results and hardly any wishlists. The company I payed promised that the game would get thousands of wishlists and influencers would play it, but that never happened. Some YouTubers with few subscribers did play the game (but “influencer” kind of implies they have a few thousand subscribers at least) plus the YouTubers who played it only got it from Steam curators and a Keymailer promotion that I bought too, so it was all separate from that “marketing campaign”. Huge hassle, and they even threatened me with legal action if I didn’t pay them more money.\n\nMaking this game fucked up my mental health for over a year, wasted tons of money, time and energy. All of this effort, only for it to not amount to anything. But I was dumb enough to keep working on it, make it to the finish line, and release it on Steam, for literally no reason. Can I say I made a game on Steam? Yes, but was it worth it? Hell no. At this point, I’ve accepted the fact I lost all of that money and that the game was pretty much a failure.\n\nEdit: Oh my god thank you for all your comments, I wasn’t expecting this many. Sorry if this post came across as super dramatic, but I felt horrible and I just had to vent. Also I don’t use Reddit much, so I didn’t realize that people could just find my game by looking at my profile- (and it looks like somebody here commented it anyway, so if you’re wondering [here it is](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3048340/Mr_Goofers_Mini_Game_Arcade_Party/)). The point of the post wasn’t about my game though, it was about the process. Once again thank you all for your response, I’m reading through them all and it genuinely means so much.",

There is currently 50+ packs with 1000's of sounds and hours of field recordings all perfect for game SFX and UI. You can get them all from [this page here](https://signaturesounds.org/) with no sign up or newsletter nonsense.\n\nWith Squarespace it does ask for a lot of personal information [so you can use this site to make up fake address](https://testingbot.com/free-online-tools/random-address-generator) and just use a fake name and email if you're not comfortable with providing this info. I don't use it for anything but for your own piece of mind this is probably beneficial.\n\nThese sounds have been downloaded millions of times and used in many games, especially the Playing Card SFX pack and the Foley packs.\n\nI think game designers can benefit from a wide range of sounds on the site, especially those that enhance immersion and atmosphere. Useful categories include:\n\n* Field recordings (e.g. forests, beaches, roadsides, cities, cafes, malls, grocery stores etc etc..) – great for ambient world-building.\n* Foley kits – ideal for character or object interactions (e.g. footsteps, hits, scrapes) there are thousands of these.\n* Unusual percussion foley (e.g. Coca-Cola Can Drum Kit, Forest Organics, broken light bulb shakes, Lego piece foley etc) – perfect for crafting unique UI sounds or in-game effects.\n* Atmospheric loops, music and textures – for menus, background ambience, or emotional cues.\n\nI hope you find some useful sounds for your games! Would love to see what you do with them if you use them but remember they are CC0 so no need to reference me or anything use them freely as you wish.\n\nJoin me at [r/musicsamplespacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicsamplespacks/) if you would like as that is where I will be posting all future packs. If you guys know of any other subreddits that might benefit from these sounds feel free to repost it there.\n\nPhil",

You can check it out here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1756020/Super_Roboy/\n\nWhat I Did:\n\n- Ran a (modestly) successful Kickstarter – raised ~$2,000 for marketing.\n- Built a following on Reddit and Twitter.\n- Hired a marketing guy.\n- Set up a full marketing stack: website, mailing list, trailers, ads, etc.\n- Got coverage: streamers played it and liked it, Gamerant gave it an 8/10, YouTubers made videos.\nSteam reviews are “Very Positive” (60+ reviews so far).\n\nThe Numbers:\n\n-,Game price: $15\n- 5 months post-launch: ~1,000 sales\n- Total revenue (after discounts, VAT, regional pricing, taxes, Steam’s cut, etc.): ~$3,000\n- I bought a good laptop for gamedev and a pricey FL Studio plugin for music\n- What’s left: ~$1,000, which I used to treat myself to a Steam Deck\n\nSo, was it a success?\n\nFinancially? Not even close. Even with all the “right” boxes checked—Kickstarter, streamers, good reviews, solid marketing—it made very little money.\n\nBut personally? Absolutely.\n\nAround 1,000 people bought and loved my game.\nPeople told me they had a great time playing it.\nPeople made a fan wiki. There are walkthroughs. That blows my mind.\nI had an absolute blast making it and sharing it.\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI already make a solid living doing what I love (tattoo artist), so gamedev is a hobby for me, not something I depend on. That probably helps me stay positive about the outcome.\n\nEnd of the day: don’t expect anything crazy. You’re not special and neither is your game—just like I’m not and mine isn’t.\n\nBut making something, putting it out into the world, and seeing even a few people truly enjoy it? That’s so worth it.\n\nHave fun everyone, you’re all awesome!\n\nEdit 1: 3000 profit, not revenue.\n\nEdit 2: thanks everyone, I’m happy this post resonates with you, and I appreciate the feedback!\n\nEdit 3: Alright I understand this post sounds negative in some ways, like “you’re not special and neither is your game”. But I’m super happy with the results, with the fact I made a game, and the reception, and I’m going to keep making games because I love it so much! And I’m not let down by the numbers, at all, or by the fact that I’m not special and neither is my game - this is a hobby and it’s so much fun! And just the fact we’re all making games is special in itself.",

In game dev, there's no specific number in what’s successful and what’s not. If we consider being a household name, then there is a minuscule number of games that hold that title.\n\n You can grow an audience for your game, whether it be in the tens to hundreds or thousands, but because it didn’t hit a specific number doesn’t mean it's not successful? \n\nA lot of people on this subreddit are confused about what success is. But if you have people who genuinely go out of their way to play your game. You’ve made it. \n\nSome low-quality games go way higher in popularity than an ultra-realistic AAA game. It’s demotivating for a lot of developers who are told they’ll never become popular because the chances are too low, and for those developers, make it because it’s fun, not because you want a short amount of fame.\n\nI don’t want this post to come off as aggressive, but it’s my honest thoughts on a lot of the stereotypes of success in game development",

    "chunk_text": "DO NOT CHANGE the Steam release date for your game or demo within 14 days of release! It can COMPLETELY NEGATE your release visibility round! I learned this the sad way :( Steamworks prevents you from changing the release date yourself within this time period, but there's a note saying that if you \\*do\\* need to change it during this time period, to contact Steam support. I did this because I felt my demo needed some more playtesting before releasing it on Steam, and they agreed to do so as a one time courtesy, and they changed my release date from May 21st to a week later on May 28th, as I requested. But then when the demo did come out on May 28th, there was no demo release visibility boost. No increase in wishlists, not even an increase in daily page visits. My demo released completely silently.\n\nI contacted support again asking them about this, and they just confirmed that it's almost certainly due to the release date being changed within that 14 day period. I also asked about the possibility of them triggering a visibility round for it for me, since I didn't get one on release, but they didn't respond to or acknowledge that part of my message, which I am assuming means they can't or won't. Which I understand, it is my mistake that caused this in the first place. But it is pretty devastating.\n\nEdit: It seems like there’s conflicting information about this topic. User u/twas_now commented below that this is not how this would work, and explained why based on their knowledge of steamworks. Though there are a few others in the comments that seemingly validate my warning with their own knowledge or experience. This is my first game, so I was just going off of what I was told by Steam support, I apologize if it is incorrect.",

Hello, so I'm currently experimenting with a Real-Life Zombie Apocalypse game concept where you run around outside and you get chased by zombies.\n\nHowever, right now I appear to be capped at around 30 or so zombies before my game starts to slow down a bit. So it's more like a Zombie Inconvenience versus an Apocalypse.\n\n30 is thankfully more than enough for now and I'm learning about app profiling so I'll soon have some hard data about what is causing the most slowdown (it may not even be the pathing algorithm), but this situation did make me think about other more complicated games that seem to run relatively smoothly even though hundreds of enemies are on screen.\n\nMy only knowledge of pathing is to use the A\\* pathing algorithm, because it's the fast one and that is the depths of my knowledge.\n\nBut I started thinking about how it would scale if you increase the number of enemies to hundreds or thousands and also if the complexity of the map scaled to like 1000x1000 or even beyond that.\n\nI figured there are likely some tricks that people use to not have to recalculate a path for hundreds of enemies over and over again. Especially if it's a long path.\n\nI apologise if this is a broad question, but I was just generally curious about it. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.",

    "chunk_text": "Hoyoverse/Genshin Impact hasn't paid me during 1 year for services provided facing a confidential project Hello, my name is Alex.\n\nIn April 2024, I contacted Hoyoverse looking for job opportunities and collaboration. To my surprise (or misfortune), they were starting a \"confidential\" project involving map creation, which according to Houchio Kong, the employee I was in contact with was set to revolutionize the industry. He stated that over 300 people were working on it and that Hoyoverse was investing heavily.\n\nWith 9 years of experience in UGC (particularly in the Minecraft community), I joined the project in its early phase, working directly with Houchio Kong and later under Nicholas Chang. We discussed the progress of the engine and Hoyoverse's future plans.\n\nEventually, they needed builders. I was officially registered in their system to help them recruit. Over time, I built a vetted team of 42 developers, all deemed \"qualified\" by Hoyoverse after several back and forths and spreadsheet revisions.\n\nIn August 2024, a contract was drafted to keep me involved, with a vague clause: \"TBD' (Seeking map builders for UGC Project of Party A.) I'd never seen such an undefined clause especially after having already done the work. I later realized this was simply a way to keep me on board without compensation.\n\nThey assured me that in January 2025, this \"TBD\" clause would finally be defined, and I’d be told my compensation. I continued helping daily attending meetings, advising, sending proposals, and even putting them in touch with dev teams in Los Angeles, as requested.\n\nWhen January arrived, I asked for the promised contract update. Instead, Nicholas Chang informed me of further delays and that the contract would now come in March or April. Around this time, Houchio Kong left the company, and Nicholas Chang became my sole contact.\n\nBy then, I had been working with Hoyoverse for nearly a year without a single payment. Still, I was told to wait because a beta phase was coming in April/May.\n\nThat beta happened, but none of the 42 developers I had recruited and who had been approved were even considered. I had received nothing for my time, effort, or professional contributions.\n\nIn April, I began formally requesting payment via email. The only replies I received were delays, vague future promises, and empty words about \"reviewing my case.\" Three weeks ago, after I mentioned going public, I was told I would receive \"a new offer\" but only if I signed an NDA first. That offer made no mention of my past work, nor did it include any clear payment terms. Instead, it required all future developers I recommend to go through a new vetting process just like before.\n\nToday, after three ultimatums (42 emails in the last two months) and a call with Nicholas Chang, I was told they need another four weeks just to \"evaluate\" my proposal. My proposal is simple: pay me what I’m owed for the work I’ve already done under the agreement.\n\nI've now notified Hoyoverse that I will share my experience publicly, as others may have gone through the same thing. I’m just one worker, but enough is enough.\n\nThis ongoing situation and Hoyoverse's failure to honor their commitments have caused me serious financial hardship. Imagine dedicating yourself to a project with passion and commitment, only to be left unpaid during all these months.\n\nA company of this scale should not be allowed to treat workers this way. That’s why I’m sharing this publicly and will continue to do so until I receive fair compensation, and to prevent others from experiencing what I’ve gone through.\n\nSincerely,\nAlex",

You'll have some natural credibility since you live in the area. If you don't have a portfolio, you'll need one. Very few business owners are going to hire you without seeing your work. If you don't have one, offer four local businesses a free website in exchange for a review. This might be controversial but it gets you established and kicks off your Google reviews.\n\nBecome a hosting reseller and create a package for site maintenance, security and updates. That will build a stream of recurring income.\n\nNext, get a list of business owners in your area. You can buy lists - I buy aged lists; $50 for 5,000 business listings. Then I Google their sites, identify the ones that don't have a site (only FB) ones that suck; outdated, not responsive, and call them. At this stage, I have two telemarketers working for me - they make the calls and book my appointments.\n\nJoin your local chamber of commerce.

    "chunk_text": "Design Wisdom I Wish I Knew Earlier — An Open Letter to All After working for a few years at a design company, I had the opportunity to learn from a designer with more experience than me in various areas of UI/UX, typography and user experience. I want to share with y'all a list of valuable advice I received from her. These tips really helped me accelerate my learning and become more productive in design overall. Since she helped me so much, I’d love to pass on these insights to help other beginners or even experienced designers, grow faster.\n\nTL;DR – Some of the most helpful recommendations she gave me include:\n\n* Typographica’s Independent Type Foundry Reviews\n* FlowClub\n* Rosart Project (KABK MA Revival Project)\n* Future Fonts\n* The Pyte Foundry\n* Type Design Resources GitHub Repo\n* Fontstand\n* TYPODARIUM (Print Calendar)\n* Velvetyne Type Foundry\n* Open Foundry\n* Tiro Typeworks Articles & Notes\n* Counterpunch by Fred Smeijers\n\nI won’t go into detail on each one here to keep this post short, but overall, these are some real gems, a wonderful list for learning and growth, especially for those in UI design or anyone looking to explore the full potential of user experience, whether for personal projects or professional work.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of some of these or want to know more about any of them, feel free to ask in the comments I’m happy to share more in my own words. And if you’d like the full write-up, just shoot me a DM! The goal is to help others become better designers.",

Need guidance on cookie-based authentication I've built an open-source tool called Reddit-Migrate that helps users transfer their data between Reddit accounts, and I want to make sure I'm fully compliant with Reddit's API terms and policies before promoting it further.\n\n# What the Tool Does\n\n**Reddit-Migrate** allows users to transfer:\n\n* Subreddit subscriptions\n* Saved posts\n* Followed users\n\nFrom one Reddit account to another, running entirely locally on the user's machine.\n\n# Technical Implementation Details\n\n**Authentication Method:**\n\n* Uses cookie-based authentication (user provides their own Reddit cookies)\n* No OAuth app registration required from users\n* Cookies are processed locally - never sent to external servers\n\n**API Usage:**\n\n* Uses official Reddit API endpoints:\n   * `/api/me.json` for account verification\n   * `/subreddits/mine/subscriber` for fetching subscriptions\n   * `/api/subscribe` for subscribing to subreddits\n   * `/user/{username}/saved` for saved posts\n   * `/api/save` for saving posts\n   * Similar endpoints for user follows\n\n**Rate Limiting:**\n\n* Implements delays between API calls to respect rate limits\n* Batches requests where possible (e.g., 100 subreddits per batch)\n* Large migrations can take several minutes due to conservative rate limiting\n\n**Privacy/Security:**\n\n* Tool runs on localhost:5005\n* All data processing happens locally\n* No external servers involved\n* User cookies never leave their machine\n\n# Specific Policy Questions\n\n1. **Cookie Authentication**: Is using user-provided cookies for API access compliant? The tool doesn't store or transmit these cookies anywhere.\n2. **Bulk Operations**: Does transferring hundreds of saved posts/subscriptions violate any bulk usage policies, even with rate limiting?\n3. **Account Migration Use Case**: Is helping users migrate their own data between their own accounts an acceptable use case?\n4. **Distribution**: Is it okay to distribute this as open-source software for users to run locally?\n5. **API Terms Compliance**: Are there any specific terms I should be aware of that might affect this use case?\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* Tool is intended for personal use only (users migrating their own data)\n* No commercial use or data collection\n* Respects rate limits and implements delays\n* Users must provide their own cookies (tool doesn't scrape or hack anything)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/nileshnk/reddit-migrate](https://github.com/nileshnk/reddit-migrate)\n\nI've read through the [API Terms](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), but I'd appreciate guidance from the community on whether this implementation raises any red flags.\n\n**Main concern**: I want to ensure the cookie-based authentication approach and bulk migration functionality don't inadvertently violate any policies.\n\nThanks for any insights! Happy to provide more technical details if needed.\n\n**TL;DR**: Built a local tool that uses Reddit cookies to migrate user data between accounts.
