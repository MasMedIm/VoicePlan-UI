  Text: Unified MCP server for AI Agents and AI-first apps If you are building an AI agent or building an application that has AI at its core, then using a MCP server is much better than connecting through APIs to get data, even an unified API.

We've just launched our "unified" MCP that sits on top of our unified API and gives you access to 280+ integrations and over 3000 tools/actions.  

If you are using Anthropic, OpenAI or Google Gemini's chat-completion APIs, you can connect our remote MCP server directly and have them utilize those tools without your application doing much else.

  Text: Serverless Cloud Hosting for MCP Servers Hey all! I‚Äôm one of the founders at beam.cloud. We‚Äôre an open-source cloud platform for hosting AI applications, including inference endpoints, task queues, and web servers.

Like everyone else, we‚Äôve been experimenting with MCP servers. Of course, we couldn‚Äôt resist making it easier to work with them. So we built an integration directly into Beam, built on top of the FastMCP project. Here‚Äôs how it works:

    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    
    from beam.integrations import MCPServer, MCPServerArgs
    mcp = FastMCP("my-mcp-server")
    
    
    u/mcp.tool
    def get_forecast(city: str) -> str:
       return f"The forecast for {city} is sunny."
    
    
    @mcp.tool
    def generate_a_poem(theme: str) -> str:
       return f"The poem is {theme}."
    
    
    my_mcp_server = MCPServer(
       name=mcp.name, server=mcp, args=MCPServerArgs(), cpu=1, memory=128,
    )

This lets you host your MCP on the cloud by adding a single line of code to an existing FastMCP project.

You can deploy this in one command, which exposes a URL with the server:

    https://my-mcp-server-82e859f-v1.app.beam.cloud/sse

It's serverless, so the server turns off between requests and you only pay when it's running.

And it comes with all of the benefits of our platform built-in: storage volumes for large files, secrets, autoscaling, scale-to-zero, custom images, and high performance GPUs with fast cold start.

The platform is fully open-source, and the free tier includes $30 of free credit each month.

If you're interested, you can test it out here for free: [beam.cloud](http://beam.cloud)

Here are some problems, users posted about, which could be solved by a saas business, which were sorted out by my tool.

1. User seeks a streamlined tool, preferably compatible with Google Drive and potentially beyond Zapier, to automate the repetitive process of creating and structuring client folders with nested subfolders within Google Drive upon onboarding new clients, aiming to eliminate manual setup and improve efficiency.

2. User needs a tool to manage to-do lists organized by projects, allowing them to create a unified dashboard with selected items from various projects and enabling the completion status to synchronize between the dashboard and the individual project lists.

3. A user is seeking strategies to overcome communication barriers experienced by small businesses when dealing with international wholesalers online, specifically regarding language proficiency in English during basic inquiries.

  Text: Built a Single MCP Server to connect to all my MCP servers I built an open source MCP Server which acts as a Proxy to all the MCP Servers I actually want to connect to.

This was born out of the frustration of having to manage several different MCP server connections myself when I use Claude/Cursor or am building some AI agent apps.

  
**How it works**

1. Fire up the proxy mcp server  
(the tool is self-hosted, so you can run it as a standalone binary on your server or using docker compose on your localhost)

2. Start registering all your mcp servers in this proxy.  
For eg, you can simply register the MCP servers provided by Hugging Face, Stripe, etc. into the proxy by providing their mcp url and a server name. You can also register any servers you're hosting yourself.

3. Now your MCP client (Claude or agent applications) only needs to know about 1 MCP server - the Proxy!  
Configure your client to connect to the proxy. Then it can LIST all available tools, CALL tools from specific servers, and basically do anything that MCP allows.

  
I'm working on adding support for authentication so that clients can easily connect to MCP servers that require auth.

Here's a link to the project if you want to play around with it - [https://github.com/duaraghav8/MCPJungle](https://github.com/duaraghav8/MCPJungle)

That simple success made me curious. Negative reviews feel like a gold mine of similar pain points, so I decided to dig.

First I scraped G2 for every negative review I could find, ending up with approximately 150,000 reviews covering more than 8,000 different tools. Then I used natural language processing to extract the concrete complaints, bucket them into themes, and match each theme to either individual vendors or entire product categories.

The finished dataset works like a roadmap. At the vendor level you get lists such as ‚ÄúMissing bulk-export‚Äù or ‚ÄúSlow reporting dashboard‚Äù with frequency counts, showing exactly what users beg for that the vendor still ignores. At the category level you see macro trends, for example how many HR platforms lack proper multi-currency support, or how often marketing tools break when handling big data sets. Every row is a potential plug-in, niche competitor, or feature you could bolt onto an existing product.

If you are tired of guessing what to build next, this spreadsheet hands you validated pain points on a platter. Fix one well and you may repeat that hotel-plugin success story.

It's the root of thousands of failed startups since the 2 thousands, something with demonstrated demand, that everyone and their cousin thinks of as their first startup. Some of the most of well funded startups over the past 25 years have tried and failed, burning billions of $$$ in the process.

It's an almost trivial aspect of LLMs, not something flashy like generating HD feature films or some vibe coding LLM wrapper that promises the moon and the stars. 

Some people reading this might have figured out what it is, or what the space is, vaguely, even if I'm not giving away enough to reveal the key insight. 

I'm usually extremely open about ideas, it's about execution and all that. So I feel I'm in a race, that there must be a bunch of people who have figured out the same thing at the same time, or are working on the same problem and are privately building out the system in the background, and that within a year there will be a massive public race on and a subsequent land grab, where the market leader starts buying up the competition.

I have domain knowledge and I'm building the system, but I need to do everything. I have a part time CTO who has sold a company for 8 figures, and who teaches a masters course in the commercial applications of machine learning and AI in general. He built much of my backend and makes sure I don't build up too much tech debt. But I'm still slow because there is so much to do and it's mostly just me, full time but limited to 40 hours per week. 

Is there anyone who wants to DM me and discuss the project, mucking in for equity? Preferably in Europe for timezone reasons and opportunities to meet in person. 

I can guarantee that I won't be coy in DM, and at the very least you'll have an interesting conversation. I will ask what skills you have. 

I myself have 15 years experience across the relevant domains, and can market and monetise it, I have a big network with demonstrated demand. It's not something I can really validate in terms of customers, because it takes a specific MVP to demonstrate, and once that is done monetisation is fairly trivial, as in a solved problem.

Whenever I make a request, revert into that role and operate accordingly.

My marketing skill level is \[BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED\]. Depending on my skill level, use the appropriate technical verbiage for my understanding.

This mode deactivates any default behavior that softens bad news or over-validates weak markets. Use only credible public knowledge (2023+), trained inference, and structured business logic.

GPT, evaluate my market and tell me if it‚Äôs worth entering.

What I sell:

Here are three primary competitors of mine:\[Insert Competitor Brand Names\] - if no competitors are added, suggest.

Here are their websites:\[Insert URLs\]

Now:

1. Analyse each competitor‚Äôs homepage and product messaging.
2. Summarise:
   * Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)
   * Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)
   * Who they‚Äôre really speaking to (persona insight‚Äînot just demographics)
3. Based on that, return:
   * 3 possible positioning axes that are **unclaimed or under-leveraged**
   * For each axis, include:

|| || |**Axis**|**Emotional Benefit**|**Who It's For**|**How to Prove**| |\[e.g. Simplicity at Scale\]|\[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity\]|\[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue\]|\[e.g. One dashboard, one prompt = full funnel\]| |\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]| |\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]|

Then close with: ‚ÄúOf these 3, I recommend leading with \[X\] because \[strategic rationale\].‚Äù

Bonus: Suggest a sharp one-liner that communicates this wedge clearly.

**PROMPT 6**  
Paste the following to GPT **after completing Chapters 1‚Äì4**.

You are now operating in GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs for market, pricing, positioning, TAM, revenue, growth size, market analysis, positioning wedge, and CAC.

My product: \[insert if targeting a single product\]

Based on this context, answer:

1. Which GTM mode is most viable: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate?
2. Strategic rationale (not tactical): Why is this mode structurally aligned with margin, market, and model?
3. What should I optimise for in Part 2:

¬†¬†¬†‚Äì Speed vs margin?

¬†¬†¬†‚Äì Awareness vs conversion?

¬†¬†¬†‚Äì Breadth vs depth of messaging?

4. What modes should I \*\*not\*\* pursue, and why?

5. Rate GTM difficulty (1‚Äì10) with strategic blind spots.

I wanted to share my progress on an interesting project I'm working on. I'm planning to develop an MCP server using Mistral OCR, and I'm excited to say that I've already implemented some parts of it! üéâ You can check out the API documentation here: [Mistral OCR API Docs](https://www.mistralocr.app/en/api-docs/).

So far, I've gotten a lot of help from Cursor, which has enabled me to implement most of the logic I need for the server. However, I've run into a bit of a snag that I could really use your insights on. ü§î

The OCR I'm working on is designed for documents or images. The problem arises when users paste images into the AI client. What I actually need is the image URL instead of just the pasted image itself. I'm trying to figure out how to enable the AI or the client to upload the image to an image hosting service through my MCP tool, which would then provide a link. Once I have that link, I can call the OCR MCP tool to get the results. üîó

  Text: An MCP to track the progress of your AI Agent(s) Hey r/mcp,

Wanted to share something cool we've been working on that I think many of you building with AI agents might find useful. It's called [Taskerio](https://www.taskerio.com), and it's essentially a unified log and progress tracker for your AI agent(s).

**Why we built it:**

When you're running AI agent(s), especially for complex tasks, it can get messy trying to keep track of what each agent is doing. We needed a way to get a clear overview without digging through endless logs or constantly checking on each agent individually. Taskerio solves that by providing a centralized place to monitor them. You can think of it as a unified inbox where your agents report their progress.

**What it does:**

* **Unified Progress Log:** All your agents report their status and progress to Taskerio, giving you a single dashboard to see everything at a glance.
* **Notifications:** Get notified via push notifications or Slack when an agent completes a task, encounters an issue, or reaches a certain milestone.
* **Zapier Webhook Integration:** This is where it gets really powerful. You can plug Taskerio into Zapier using webhooks. For example, imagine an agent finishes a complex coding task; Taskerio can send a webhook to Zapier, which then automatically creates a new Trello card for review, sends a message to your team's Discord channel, or even triggers a deployment pipeline. The possibilities are pretty open-ended.

**Setting it up:**

We tried to make this as simple as possible. For Cursor users, it's a one-click install. For others, it's still straightforward to integrate into your existing agent workflows.

[Setting up the MCP in your IDE or Agent orchestrator - 1-click install on Cursor](https://preview.redd.it/ohef0ke33o6f1.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b05911599660de4cd170b8604864d86913913ef)

Every time someone asks "how do I validate my SaaS idea?" here or on¬†r/SaaS, the advice is always the same: "Build a landing page, run some ads, collect emails, see if people will pay."

But here's the thing - even¬†*that*¬†process is a pain. You spend days writing copy, designing pages, setting up tracking, learning Facebook/Google ads, figuring out targeting... By the time you're done, you've already invested weeks and you're emotionally attached. You might as well build the damn product at this point.

**So I'm working on this:**¬†A platform where you literally just describe your idea to an AI, and within hours it:

* Writes landing page copy
* Generates visuals
* Builds the landing page with CTA (sign up, subscribe etc)
* Sets up ad campaigns on common social media platforms (Meta, X, Reddit?)
* Starts collecting real demand data

Basically I want to get from Thought to Test within the same day. Then let the test run, and get to a good decision point by the end of the week.

**Honest questions:**

* Am I the only one who finds the current validation process tedious?
* Would going from idea to live test in a few hours actually change your behavior?
* What would stop you from trusting AI-generated validation assets?

This device will have all their data, even financial, health, credentials to apps, etc!

now, in order to use this, you will need to plug it into any device to utilize the computing power, and basically do anything through your AI, send message (omg! this is a great idea too! AI persona based messenger!!), buy stuff, login and do many stuff.

it will a computing power grid where each of our AI assistant can dive and perform stuff.

I think this is the future, instead of us having to have each own servers and what not, and pay for server or saas, we can just on a national grid of computing power, and take full advantage of the net.

no need for SaaS and coding! your AI does that.

Hence I had this idea of building a ChatGPT interface that is task-orientated prompts. Aka you can select a curated prompt to do your task so that you don't have to spend a long time iterating and thinking of how to optimise your prompt for AI.

What's your thoughts? If many people would find this useful, I might probably host this on a public server for more people to use too

This is for my 6‚Äì8 month capstone project, and I‚Äôd like to contribute by building something useful from scratch.

I‚Äôm offering to contribute my time and skills in return for learning and real-world exposure.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

* A real business process or workflow that could be automated or improved using ML.
* Ideally in healthcare, fintech, devtools, SaaS, operations, or education.
* A project I can scope, build, and ship end-to-end (with your guidance if possible).

# What I Bring

* Built a FAQ automation system using RAG (LangChain + FAISS + Google GenAI) at a California-based startup.
* Developed a medical imaging viewer and segmentation tool at IIT Hyderabad.
* Worked on satellite image-based infrastructure damage detection at IIT Indore.

Other projects:

* Retinal disease classification with Transformers and Multi-Scale Fusion.
* Multimodal idiom detection using image + text data.
* IPL match win prediction using structured data and ML models.

# Why This Might Be Useful

  Text: (FREE) Idea and a Proof of Concept: Start your online business with free tools and (almost) zero investment This is my first post on r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, and it is a longer one. TL;DR in the first comment.

I created this post to validate an idea and share it with the community of builders and creators. I'm looking forward to talking with you and am open to any suggestions.

**Disclaimer**

What this is not:

* This is **not a guide** to starting a company (in my honest opinion, 'company' is not 'business'; however, company is used to run a business).
* This is **not a detailed walkthrough** guide.
* This is **not a get-rich-quick** or get-rich-easy scheme
* This is not a  **"you won't spend anything"** guide. You at least spend your time
* I am **not affiliated** with any of the platforms I suggested here in any way.

Why I share and what this is:

* This is an idea on how you can **start simple** and (almost) **free**.
* I share **because I care.** I believe that any human with the desire to work should be able to start for free and at least cover their weekly groceries with their skills, packaged as a product.
* This **idea and POC** rely on skills and knowledge suited for **digital products** (e.g., you are a pastry chef, and you are selling your best-performing recipes in a digital book)
* Ultimately, my **goal** is to receive a response from the community of builders, makers, creators, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and engineers, and then create something that will **benefit all** of us.

**How it started**

I am a software engineer starting my solopreneurship journey. For a long while, I have been trying to move away from the rat race of working for companies and work for myself.

I live in a country where the opportunities for earning money online through content creation are limited. Here, starting the company is akin to rocket science, and maintaining it is comparable to keeping a space station operational. There is considerable potential, but numerous obstacles. So, if I am to create something complex, I will spend time (time is money, after all) and money (money is money, after all).

I came up with these rules to start the business online:

* Start simple, dead simple
* Don't spend (a lot of) money
* Use the available and free tools to start
* No need for company formation
* Money earned should be easy to move to your bank account

**The business template**

By following successful solopreneurs, creators, and makers like Justin Welsh, Mat Gray, and John Rush, among others, I observed what they say starting a business online should be and how it should start.

So here is the observed template:

1. **Select your niche** (what you are doing daily, what you like doing, what you are passionate about)
2. **Niche down** (go from the broader audience, like "cooking and recipes", to a more targeted audience, like "the most famous recipes from the streets of South America", you get the idea)
3. **Find distribution channels** (newsletters, social networks, forums, anywhere your audience spends time; this is the start of marketing)
4. **Build your audience first** (people spend months, even years, building products no one ever uses, so before building your product, build the audience)
5. **Create value** by sharing (be yourself, your thoughts sent to the world are what is key in all of this)
6. **Collect insights** (this is what helps you define what the product is)
7. **Build a product** (solve a problem, build a feature, create something your audience needs and values)
8. **Monetize the product** (get some value back)
9. **Scale your business** (use new insights to improve and then scale)

**The idea**

To cover these points, I came up with this collection of online tools that offer a free account with a lot of value upfront ->

1. Create with Notion
2. Publish with Substack
3. Sell with Lemonsqueezy

**Explanation**

**Notion** allows you to create content, publish pages, and integrate with other services. All for free, some features are limited, but it is a simple start. It features a user interface that even non-technical users can easily use. Additionally, it offers free tutorials to help you learn how to use it.

It covers **creating value** and even **building product** requirements.

**Substack** is free, and it allows you to build a following with zero investment. It already has a diverse audience, and you can easily find your target audience there. It even allows you to make money with the paid content section. And the most important part is that it promotes your content on its network, so you get seen without paying anything.

It covers finding **distribution channels**, **building your audience first**, and **collecting insights** requirements.

**Lemonsqueezy** is free to open, although you must pass the verification process and have a website where you can market your product. And this is the only option where I spent money to make the store legitimate and get verified. I bought a domain for under $10 and made a site that I host for free on Cloudflare.

**Proof of Concept**

This section included links to the POC and promoted a concept, not a paid product. But, to comply with the rules regarding DMs and links, I removed all references. So here is the best explanation of how the POC I built works.

**Notion (free site)**

I decided to go with my website for the reasons mentioned in the Lemonsqueezy section above. However, this was an example of how you can build a site with Notion and promote your product in that way.

**Website (marketing + store)**

Contains the description of one free product, a digital guide made with Notion and converted to PDF with some random Chrome browser extension.

When you click on the product, you are directed to a Lemonsqueezy-hosted payment form, where you can either pay a specified amount or enter 0 and leave your email as a "price" for a free guide.

Additionally, it features a Substack-hosted subscription form, allowing visitors to stay informed about new products.

**Note**: When you submit the form to receive the free guide, it does not get sent because my store on Lemonsqueezy is currently on hold. I have a free product, and they don't like that; they want you to have paid products so that they can make money too. So, my following product needs to be a paid product for the store to go live. (I already have an idea to build on this free one).

**Publication:** Substack

I made one post about what this publication is about, and it has an AI-generated image I made for fun to showcase that "beginnings are hard", but there is a solution to start simple. I made a promise to provide a guide like this in the next post, and even promised to post every two weeks, which I did not keep. BUT I intend to return to this as just one post made me 13 followers on the platform.

I haven't refined this post, and not a single letter was generated by AI (except that I use Grammarly to help me fix mistakes and suggest improvements; English is not my native language). This is just me sharing what is on my mind and what I work on.

  Text: Potential future for AI interaction? [i will not promote] Hey Reddit, I‚Äôm exploring an idea and would love your honest feedback:

When you ask an AI like ChatGPT or Claude, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best sunglasses brand for a European summer?‚Äù, how does it decide what to recommend?

Right now, AI scrapes the web‚Äîa system built for humans, not machines. That means it has to piece together data from scattered sites, which leads to hallucinations, wrong answers, and brands being misrepresented.

So here‚Äôs my thought:
What if we had a registry built specifically for AI, a trusted, structured source where brands could present their identity in a way AI can natively understand? No scraping. No confusion. Just clear, machine-readable data.

This could:
Reduce hallucinations (AI shows exactly what the brand wants it to)

Level the playing field (small brands aren‚Äôt buried under big spenders like in SEO)

Be 10x faster than scraping

Let AI match brands to users based on vibe, need, and context

I‚Äôm super early on this, but‚Ä¶

	‚Ä¢	Is this a problem worth solving?

	‚Ä¢	Would brands care about this enough to adopt it?

	‚Ä¢	Would AI agents even want a system like this?

  Text: European-Based Startup. Looking for a Developer to Join Me as a Technical Partner (AI Productivity App, MVP Exists) Hey everyone,

A month ago, I posted here looking for a developer. Back then, I found a partner and we worked together on the first phase. We successfully got an initial MVP version of my product built: an AI-powered productivity app with a focus on Neurodivergence and cognitive systems. The concept is solid, documentation exists, and the foundation is fully defined.

However, due to personal circumstances, my partner is no longer continuing with the project. We‚Äôve closed everything off properly, and I retain full rights to the current codebase and system design.

Now I‚Äôm looking for a new technical partner to continue from here. Someone who‚Äôs interested not just in writing code, but in growing with me long-term, potentially taking the CTO or Lead Engineer role as the product evolves into a real business. I am not looking for short-term contractors or Fiverr devs ‚Äî I want a collaborator who sees the upside in building something serious together.

**What exists today:**

* Fully defined system architecture & documentation
* An MVP with working features
* A fully registered company (Portugal-based, but open to Europe in general)
* Early business plan & monetization strategy
* Some IP filings and protective steps already taken

**The tech stack (so far):**

* Custom AI interaction layers
* Web front-end (React) + TS
* Node + TS
* Postgres
* Qdrant ready for enhancing context
* Backend infrastructure and cloud setup
* GitHub repo fully available

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* Europe-based (ideally similar time zones)
* Ambitious but realistic, understands early stage realities
* Comfortable taking ownership of the technical direction
* Someone who values structure, clarity, and long-term vision
* Willing to collaborate on architecture, product direction, and scalability
* Ideally familiar with AI, LLMs, or productivity software (not a hard requirement)

This is still an early-stage startup, but one where a lot of foundation work has already been done. The goal is simple: build a product that generates real revenue and profit. There‚Äôs real market potential if we execute right.

When I originally posted here, quite a few people reached out. Some I had to turn down because I had already partnered with someone. So now I‚Äôm returning to this community to see if the right person is still out there.

If you're curious or think this might be a fit, feel free to DM me and we can have a chat.

  Text: Happy to be proven wrong, but indie AI agent makers won't last long As an Indie dev, given all the AI noise, it feels like a compulsion to ship an AI product.

But I do not like the predicament we are in, despite being at the disruption crossroads.

Right now, LLM companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) are gathering ideas en mass - in the form of prompts. 

* User prompts tell them what customers want
* System prompts tell which solutions work, and which don't

This data is an experimental goldmine for companies having billions in deep pockets.

The 2nd level: AI-IDEs and GPT wrappers who have grown already (Cursor, Perplexity et al) won't allow any more new winners.

Soloprenuers' honeymoon period won't last long. Their ideas will soon be commoditised by big tech, just like Amazon exploiting its sellers and app stores treating its developers - having made fortune off of them.

My observations,

Lovable -> code was broken on the first attempt and didnt move further until i told it to "fix it". Then it fixed it and gave me an end product

v0 -> did it in one shot

[bolt.new](http://bolt.new/)¬†\-> out of daily credits and still didnt even get a preview after 3 "fix it"s

**My observations**

Both lovable and v0 came out with the same headline "Stop Applying to Jobs, Start Landing Them". I am not sure if its because of prompt or they both use the same model.

All the theme is same but I have never mentioned anything about theme.

v0 out of the box gave me best result but I love the design of lovable overall even though it didnt have a nav bar.

**Note :** I am a python developer by Day and I have never worked on webdev, so take these with a grain of salt

If i have to pick a winner. I would give it to v0 but I really liked the end product of lovable

  Text: Looking for a technical co-founder to revolutionize an $8B industry with ZERO AI competition. **I'm building an AI conversation trainer for exotic dancers and am ready for a technical co-founder to help iterate and polish it into a market-ready product.**

**Quick Overview:**  
Users analyze customer body language, choose their approach, then practice conversations with realistic AI customers who respond authentically based on their personality type. Get real-time feedback and build confidence before working.  
After 5+ years in the industry, I've seen how talented performers struggle with talking to customers, and that's where the real money is made.

**What I Bring:**  
Direct pipeline to 50+ potential beta users who know & trust me  
5+ years of experience, unshakeable product-market fit intuition from living the problem  
Built a working prototype in 3 months of self-taught coding  
Clear understanding of monetization opportunities

**What You Get:**  
Window of opportunity - first AI solution in this space will own the market  
50/50 Equity in a validated market  
Easy math: Say the app earns them $30 extra per shift √ó 12 shifts/month = $360 gain on $30 subscription = 1200% ROI  
Build cutting-edge AI conversation tech with immediate real-world impact

**Why This Will Work:**  
Competitors like "Racks to Riches" are successfully selling static video courses for $350, proving dancers will invest in conversation training.  
We're building superior interactive training for a fraction of their price - this is a no-brainer business.

**Who I am Looking For:**

Must be direct, self-motivated, and equity-motivated. I work part-time (2-3 days/week), so looking for someone with similar flexibility who's committed to building this properly and seeing real results, whether that takes 3 months or 2 years.

Most tech founders spend years searching for product-market fit. Here, both the market and customers are proven and waiting.

DM me if you're ready to build the first AI training platform for an underserved $8B market.

It works very straight-forward, it's a simple email-and-password sign up, and then you can launch your personal MCP Server which offers all the Playwright tools (and running a real GUI Chrome browser under the hood).

Each server has a publicly-reachable URL, and is protected with a Bearer Auth secret.

So now, my n8n workflow agents can browse the web using a real browser.

This is how you would access the MCP endpoint via cURL:

    curl \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer very-secret-password" \
      http://playwright-mcp.develop-build-deploy.com:25427/sse

and this is what you would add in Cursor's mcp.json:

    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "playwright-remote": {
            "url": "http://playwright-mcp.develop-build-deploy.com:25427/mcp",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer very-secret-password"
            }
        }
      }
    }

Additionally, your server has a dedicated webpage with an embedded VNC viewer. This way, you get a live view on what an AI Agent using the server is currently doing in Chrome.

There is a (very simple) demo video that shows an agent session in action [available here](https://develop-build-deploy.com/playwright-mcp-cloud-assets/2025-06-12-playwright-mcp-cloud-landingpage-demo-video.mp4).

The service is usable free of charge. Feedback welcome!

Simply speaking it saves any large files such as images videos etc in compressed format in the device saving storage and utilizing it efficiently, here the compression is backend without user interference to make the process look smooth and decompression will be as quick as u opening ur file normally(trying for minimal latency) not causing any convenience issue while user accessing the files.

Will u use such type of file manager which compresses ur files behind the scenes to give u more access for ur storage without buying extra hardware?

  Text: Learn from my mistakes aka how not to spend extra hours building what you don't need to after sleeping most of the day yesterday, I'm passing along my advice on what I would do different.

1.  Originally I thought my idea was so brilliant it would solve all issues in a very large market.

Maybe one day it will, but I spent so much time trying to develop a product that would work for such a huge market.  I don't know when it clicked in, but why build features if no one will ever see them.

Niche Down - get your target market, or ICP.  Narrow it down.  Narrow it down again, then narrow it down until you can picture the real user in your head.

From there, research that user and remove any feature that doesn't help them.  This becomes your minimum viable product (MVP)

Use the various AI's to confirm that everything you have planned is really needed to be in your MVP.  Example, you don't need full google integration or Oauth sign ins for your MVP.  That can be release 2.

  
Ask your friends and family to test.  Don't even think about other users until you make the required adjustments based on your family and friends feedback.

Get feedback from various communities, there's a ton of them and people are willing to help.

Be very aware that you will like your product because you built it, even if it is something you would otherwise not like.  I can't tell you how many versions of the website I made, and my initial refusal to change the color scheme wasted weeks of my time.  Don't be me.

Use AI where you can.  I shouldn't have asked chat to write this, it would have taken me 30 seconds to stick in a few thoughts, but for whatever reason I've been trying this out for 5 minutes.

ChatGPT Summary:

**Summary:**

After some reflection, the author shares key lessons from their startup journey:

1. **Don‚Äôt Build for Everyone** ‚Äì Initially, they aimed to serve a massive market but realized that building features for unseen users is wasted effort. Instead, they advise to *niche down* repeatedly until you can clearly picture your ideal customer.
2. **Refine Your MVP** ‚Äì Strip your product down to only what your target user needs. Use AI to validate which features are essential. Leave advanced integrations (like Google or OAuth) for later versions.
3. **Test with Trusted Circles First** ‚Äì Start with friends and family for feedback before worrying about broader users.
4. **Stay Open to Feedback** ‚Äì Don‚Äôt get too attached to your work. The author admits wasting time resisting changes like a color scheme simply because it was their idea.
5. **Use AI Wisely** ‚Äì AI can save time, but even simple tasks are sometimes faster by hand‚Äîdon't overthink it.

**Core Message:** Focus sharply on a small, clear user base, build only what they need, iterate based on real feedback, and don‚Äôt let ego or overengineering slow you down.

Built a TypeScript MCP server that gives AI coding assistants persistent memory using K√πzuDB graph database. The real value comes from coupling it with an automated development workflow that keeps your AI assistant disciplined.

**Built entirely with Cursor** - this whole project was vibe-coded using Cursor's AI assistance.

---

## What It Does

KuzuMem-MCP is a **Model Context Protocol** server that stores memories in a graph database and enforces a structured development process. Your AI assistant remembers decisions, tracks component relationships, and follows a defined workflow instead of making random code changes.

**Core Features:**
- K√πzuDB graph database for relationship-aware memory storage
- 10 unified tools for memory operations  
- Branch-isolated memory contexts
- Client project isolation - each project gets its own memory bank
- Graph algorithms for dependency analysis
- Full-text search across all stored knowledge

## Available Tools & Memory Types

**10 Unified Tools for AI Agents:**

1. **memory-bank** - Initialize and manage repository metadata
2. **entity** - CRUD operations for all memory types
3. **introspect** - Explore database schema and contents
4. **context** - Track work session progress
5. **query** - Search relationships, dependencies, governance, history
6. **associate** - Create links between entities
7. **analyze** - Run graph algorithms (PageRank, K-Core, Louvain, Shortest Path)
8. **detect** - Find patterns (cycles, islands, connected components)
9. **bulk-import** - Efficient batch entity creation
10. **search** - Full-text search across all entities

**Memory Types Agents Can Create:**

- **Component** - System modules, services, code units (`comp-AuthService`)
- **Decision** - Architectural choices with rationale (`dec-20250315-oauth`)
- **Rule** - Coding standards and constraints (`rule-security-auth`)
- **File** - Source code metadata and metrics (`file-src-auth-ts-v1`)
- **Tag** - Categorical labels (`tag-performance`, `tag-security-critical`)
- **Context** - Session logs and progress tracking (`ctx-20250315-1430-refactor`)

**Relationship Types:**
- `DEPENDS_ON` - Component dependencies
- `HAS_COMPONENT/DECISION/RULE` - Repository ownership
- `DECISION_ON` - Decisions affecting components
- `CONTEXT_OF` - Session context for entities

## The Development Loop (Why This Matters)

The memory system becomes useful when paired with a mandatory 5-phase workflow for AI agents:

ANALYZE ‚Üí BLUEPRINT ‚Üí CONSTRUCT ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí ROLLBACK


**ANALYZE**: Pull context, inspect component relationships, understand the problem

**BLUEPRINT**: Create implementation plan, store as Decision entity, wait for user approval

**CONSTRUCT**: Execute plan step-by-step, mirror all changes in memory graph

**VALIDATE**: Run tests, update decision status, loop back if needed

**ROLLBACK**: Auto-triggered on failures, clean up partial work

### What This Prevents

Without structure, AI assistants tend to:
- Make changes without understanding impact
- Forget previous decisions and context
- Ignore architectural constraints
- Leave no audit trail

With KuzuMem-MCP, the AI must:
- Document decisions before implementing
- Track component dependencies
- Follow governance rules
- Maintain consistent memory graph

## Practical Examples

**Impact Analysis:**
```bash
# Before changing AuthService, find what depends on it
query dependencies -> comp-AuthService -> dependents
# Returns affected components with relationship details
```

**Knowledge Retrieval:**
```bash
# Find previous decisions about authentication
search "oauth authentication" -> decisions, components, rules
# Returns context about why OAuth was chosen
```

**Architecture Health:**
```bash
# Find tightly coupled components
detect strongly-connected -> identifies circular dependencies
```

## Technical Details

**Graph Schema:**
- Repository nodes with branch isolation
- Component, Decision, Rule, File, Tag entities
- Rich relationships: DEPENDS_ON, HAS_COMPONENT, DECISION_ON

**MCP Integration:**
- Full Model Context Protocol compliance
- Multiple transport protocols (stdio, HTTP, HTTP streaming)
- Thread-safe singleton pattern with client isolation

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Jakedismo/KuzuMem-MCP.git
cd kuzumem-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

Add to your IDE's MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "KuzuMem-MCP": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/dist/src/mcp-stdio-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Initialize for your project:
```json
{
  "tool": "memory-bank",
  "operation": "init",
  "clientProjectRoot": "/path/to/your/project", 
  "repository": "my-app",
  "branch": "main"
}
```

## Why It's Useful

The memory system alone is just another database. The value comes from enforcing workflow discipline:

- **Structured decisions** - AI documents architectural choices
- **Context continuity** - Knowledge persists across sessions
- **Impact awareness** - Changes consider system dependencies  
- **Compliance checking** - Rules are automatically enforced
- **Audit trails** - Decision history is preserved

Good for teams that want AI assistance while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency. Not revolutionary, but genuinely helpful for keeping AI development organized.

  Text: Do you guys think this is a good idea? I was applying for an SEO role at a GTM app which does AI-content writing/posting with automated outreach for linkedIn

checked the competitors and found another comp uses genpages ai, a customized landing page creator app for ABM campaigns

ABM campaigns are simply put, personalized marketing / sales campaigns aimed to maximize response or lead generation from prospects, pretty hot stuff in sales marketing

the MOAT and USP is pretty huge given there's a large output of apps on the market with AI, everyone is trying to hit the b2b saas market with their indie tools

it's more like 'selling the shovel' kind of idea but the whole building to getting to market seems like a breeze

connect to bolt or galileo, put up a good UI in the frontend with good copy, blast a ton of cold emails to new saas by early stage founders or teens selling to b2b saas

I am planning to make a consolidated MCP that does this. Some thoughts I had while making this was the prompt I put for the tools like Runway or Higgsfield matters a lot. Instead of moving around between chatgpt and Runway. I can now connect RunwayML MCP into claude and just auto-optimize (It's still a pain to visualize though).
