    "chunk_text": "Atlanta‚Äôs Parking Problem Is Eating Restaurants Alive  It's interesting that they complain about meters.  Don't get me wrong; it's fucked up that they're for profit, but meters mean spaces turn over, and $2/hr isn't bad at all.  \n\nIt's all the empty $20 lots that are the killer.  I'm not going to pay $20 to park for a meal; I'll just go somewhere that has a lot.  \n\nAnd obviously, a functional transit system would make everything a lot easier. ‚ÄúAtlanta‚Äôs PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION problem is eating restaurants alive‚Äù\n\nThere I fixed the headline for you‚Ä¶ I'm from here, and live here currently but after spending 3 years in chicago after college its clear this isn't and never will be a _parking problem_. Shame on Eater for using this title. This is the inevitable conclusion of trying to build a huge city that is almost exclusively dependent on privately-owned cars for transportation. There‚Äôs just not. Enough. Room. \n\nDid anyone else see that festival on the Beltline that got canceled day-of because too many people showed up and there wasn‚Äôt enough parking?! And the absolute irony of my seeing that moments after rage-reading Bill Torpy‚Äôs verbal diarrhea celebrating the death of the eastside streetcar. This city has a disease and I‚Äôm not sure what the cure is. It‚Äôs not just sit-down places.  I‚Äôm a grab-and-go gal, and I‚Äôm about to head down to Chattahoochee Works to pick up lunch; the two hours of free parking are great since I‚Äôll be there less than a half hour. Krog and PCM are out of the question for that. Sure, Krog has a few 20-minute spaces, but those are tough to get. And forget about restaurants that aren‚Äôt part of a food hall. \n\nI should add that I live near the Battery (*yes, I‚Äôd love to live in town, but I work in Woodstock and couldn‚Äôt afford a condo ITP anyway - trust me, I searched*.) I genuinely like coming into town, and I‚Äôll take MARTA if I‚Äôm making a day of it. But parking is becoming a bigger and bigger obstacle. We need public transportation, not more parking Lazy Betty pays $40,000 a year for parking? That‚Äôs crazy. That‚Äôs like a dozen meals there. Parking the issue? I mean its one of the issues. Coming from OTP to do anything in the city is a chore that I avoid now. For me to have a night out that includes a drink or two in the city is 70$ via Lyft one way, to pay $50 per person on average for a meal at a place that got overhyped on social media.  I love the city but unless I have to be there or decide to have a staycation at a hotel downtown, I don't even bother. \n\nThey need to expand MARTA yesterday. Even if there was more parking, the westside is just a PITA to get to.  14th and Howell Mill traffic sucked \\*before\\* they built all that shit.  It's just not worth going over there.",

    "chunk_text": "Kemp: Restaurants, other businesses to reopen in Georgia amid COVID-19 fight  Beltline will be slammed this weekend. What are the people who work at those places supposed to do with their kids who would usually be in school? Finally! I‚Äôm going to go pump iron, sweat on a bunch of surfaces and then lounge in a steam bath with a bunch of randos and a highly infectious disease!\n\n#FATTENtheCurve Next week he'll tell us he just found out COVID-19 and the coronavirus are the same thing.\n\n**Edit:**  Just to provide a timeline:\n\nMarch 18th: Schools Closed - 51 new cases\n\nMarch 24th: Mass gatherings/restaurants/theaters Closed - 254 new cases\n\nApril 3rd: Stay at home order - 483 new cases\n\nYesterday: 632 new cases\n\nSo yesterday we added 1200% more cases than the day he closed the schools, and we're supposed to believe *now* is the time to re-open??? Not even his own Shelter-in-Place mandate of April 30th matters now. Restaurants are opening up on the 27th! WTF. \n\nThis is ridiculous. So he has just decided that we're not going to follow the criteria that the federal government put out a few days ago regarding the rules for opening the economy back up.  Namely, that there needs to be a 14 day decline in cases for a first phase of reopening to begin.\n\nCool.\n\nEdit: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/georgia-coronavirus-cases.html ‚ÄúI got a big truck, in case I need to round up any dead bodies from the ‚Äòrona.‚Äù\n\n-Kemp, probably\n\nEdit: thanks for the ‚Äúhealthcare hero‚Äù award...I work in an ER so that fits. I feel awful for all the employees of these places that are going to be forced to either go back to work and risk exposure, or get fired for not showing up and thus be ineligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nMy wife and I can both work from home indefinitely, so we can continue to isolate as much as possible thankfully, but this is ridiculous as the majority of people aren't so fortunate.\n\nAnd WTF with bowling alleys? Even if they only open certain lanes to spread people out, does anyone believe they will (or even can) effectively sanitize the ball return system, all the shared balls etc. between lane rentals?",

    "chunk_text": "Humble Pie closes in West Midtown, one of almost a dozen restaurants in that area to close in recent months - 'additional closures are likely'  All of the closures (so far) dating to this time last year:\n\n- Humble Pie\n- Culinary Dropout\n- Snooze\n- Pour Taproom\n- West Egg Cafe\n- Cultivate\n- Le Fat\n- Slim+Husky\n- L.O.A. Social Club\n- Superica\n- Wagamama\n- Knuckies Hoagies\n- Pijiu Belly\n- Postino\n- Aziza/Falafel Nation\n- Urban Tree Cidery\n\nAnd at nearby Westside Paper:\n\n- Boxcar Betty's\n- Elsewhere Brewing\n- Bar Diver\n- Pancake Social (listed for sale)\n\n\nNot good at all... The main culprit is the rent cost for these spaces. I bet they are not cheap and the foot traffic needs to be high to justify. \n\nIf we lose Ormsbys, its over. I miss when Octane was the main event on the Westside. It's grown too fast and has too much of the same boring restaurant repeating itself over there. Hate to see some of the good original spots are going down to make room for shitty chains. NORTHSIDE TAVERN LIVES ON! I'm still so hurt losing Little Trouble 2023 :(\n\n\nI live in midtown and lament how cool the area seems for all the development but how hard it it's to get over there. Some additional bike and public transit access would make a huge difference for people like me. In a just world we'd get some kind of Marta rail access. I‚Äôm all for density but everything on  that stretch of Howell mill was poorly planned for a car driven city. As much as we try to push away from being car centric there is no easy way outside of biking to get here which blows my mind because there‚Äôs an entire Marta bus facility right there. Parking at the interlock is the second highest in the city (not to be beat by non validating at colony square) and Westside paper doesn‚Äôt have the foot traffic to drive a large amount of customers. A shame really. In the inevitable downturn we're barreling towards, this district is going to get scary, fast\n\nI live like a mile away and it's such a pain in the ass to get in and out of, there was less than zero thought about infrastructure. Like forget a MARTA stop they didn't even widen or straighten out the cow trail that is Howell Mill Holy cow! I didn‚Äôt realize there were that many. As an Eastsider I avoid that area at all costs because it‚Äôs such a pain to get to/get out of while driving and a minimum $30 uber each way if I want to have a cocktail. I was at dinner in IP recently and heard a group of 30 something‚Äôs saying the same thing at the table next to us. Pancake social was stupid. Their excessively priced model led to closure. So, no love lost on that one. That is a hell of a lot of restaurants in a concentrated space. I have always thought Atl supports their restaurants very well Thursday through Saturday, but can be empty Sunday through Wednesday.",

    "chunk_text": "Atlantans from foreign countries/food cultures, what restaurants serve the best food from your region? What do you order? Several years back people were asked where to find the best food from their countries/cultures. I think it's time to re-visit, see what's still around and what's new.\n\nI'd also like to take it one step further and ask for recommendations on what to order. At many of the places I've visited, menus are difficult to navigate for an outsider. And, while the staff at almost every place has been welcoming, they are not always super helpful.\n\n**So help us out! What should we order to experience the best of your food culture?** Las Delicias de La Abuela in Doraville is pretty good Colombian food.\nOn the weekends they sell Ajiaco üî• Korean culture is well represented and available all over metro Atlanta, but below are some of my recommendations:\n\n-Stone Bowl(Ïö∞ÎÇ®Ï†ï) in Doraville for traditional dishes\n-A-Hyang in Duluth for Korean snack & traditional food\n-Danmooji(Îã®Î¨¥ÏßÄ) is probably a favorite spot for others\n-678 for Korean bbq or K-Factory(same owners) for larger groups is also located in Duluth\n-Seorabeol(ÏÑúÎùºÎ≤å) is a 24 hour Korean restaurant(2 am is usually my time spot for Waffle House, but sometimes you need that spicy beef stew)\n-Arte 3 in Suwanee or Hansel & Gretel in Duluth have a great selection of Korean desserts(shaved ocean, waffles, etc.) \n\nLemme know if you want more suggestions. Kurt‚Äôs or Biergarten probably have the best German food. Northern China Eatery (As someone from Shenyang, China) Venezuelan here to confirm that arepa m√≠a is legit although it hurts to see the arepa prices - they are supposed to be the equivalent of a street hot dog with price to match. However, their ingredients are as authentic as you'll find a stateside (I understand they ship through Miami), and the portions are at least generous. More broadly, arepita Cafe in Alpharetta has more of the traditional dishes and style, including hallacas during Xmas time (think semi sweet tamales but in banana leaf instead of corn husk). Definitely recommend trying them out too Being originally from New Hampshire, I have to say I have yet to find a place that does authentic overcooked-until-it‚Äôs-fibrous chicken tenders with unseasoned boiled vegetables. Nobody wanted or asked for British fast food in this thread but.....\n\nWright's Fish and Chips in Cumming.  \n\nThey're closed right now because they're moving to a new location in town but they're an actual, authentic British chippy. The only one I've ever found in the USA and for sure the only one in/around the metro area.  Apparently the family who run it used to run a chippy back home which I don't doubt for a second.  It's *genuinely* authentic.\n\nIs it healthy?  Erm... No. Is it greasy British comfort food?  Heck yes...  When they reopen, fish & chips and curry sauce is where it's at.  Or maybe try the battered sausage....\n\n---\n\n[edit] Well, apparently there's some love for British stuff in this thread.  On the off chance you didn't know about [Taste of Britain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taste+of+Britain/@33.9413067,-84.2132371,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc9035231f0d2cd30?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC3ruNt-D4AhXXkGoFHU1vBzAQ_BJ6BAhgEAU) in Norcross, you're welcome.... Bangaldeshi here and you'll find the best Bangladeshi food (outside of Jackson Heights in NYC) in Atlanta.\n\nAl Amin (Buford Highway) - Order the 'Kachchi' (variant of a mutton biriyani) on Saturdays (only) and 'Beef Tehari' (beef biriyani variant, everyday). They're biriyani-like but the flavor profile in still significantly different.\n\nPurnima (Buford Highway) - Order the 'Morog Polao' (variant of a chicken biriyani)\n\nAll three items are better than most places back in Bangladesh (verified by multiple friends and family members) Egyptian American here and best mediterranean Id had was Aladdins Mediterranean Grill off Roswell Rd. Grew up going there but it closed during the pandemic. Please recommend me something else :'(",

Really pricy though\n\nFor ramen I actually like Jinya a lot but its a chain you can find all over so not too special. I honestly cant recommend any local place for their ramen. Theres always one aspect/ingredient that isnt quite right Mariscos La Costa Nayaritas, great seafood and Micheladas.\n\nLa Galagetza- decent Oaxacan food\n\nCarnitas michaocan- Carnitas pretty decent...\n\nTortas factory DF- absolutely good pambazos\n\nChicago Supermarket - good quesadillas and tacos (they would be absolute great with handmade tortillas üò©) \n\n\n\n\nEtc etc... Ethiopian: \n\n* Abol Ethiopian Restaurant \n* Although if you prefer something a little more \"Americanized\"(sorry, I don't have a better way to put it)  Desta Ethiopian Restaurant \n\nFood Reccomendations:\n\n* Tibs: Lean cubes of beef sauteed with onions, tomatoes, jalapenos and qibe (Ethiopian butter).  \n\n* Kitfo: Beef Tartare with Spiced Clarified Butter   \n\n* Veggie Combo: 4 to 5 variety of veggie dishes. Swede here. Your options are Ikea, so I guess they win by default? Get the meatballs with mashed potato, gravy, and lingonberry sauce. It's mediocre but very cost effective. \n\nBernard's bakery up in Marietta has some swedish pastry and it's pretty damn good and reasonably authentic. There's also Swedishdreamish on Instagram up in Cumming but I haven't tried her stuff. It looks really good though, and I think she's swedish so it should be authentic. Persian food \n\n\n\nRumi‚Äôs Kitchen-\n\n\nKashk badenjoon- eggplant dip with whey \n\n\nSea bass- poached in saffron, amazing \n\n\nKoobideh- ground beef kabob, delicious and authentic. \n\n\nTahdig with khoresh ghormeh sabzi- crispy rice with an herb stew \n\n\nMast khiar- yogurt with cucumbers and mint\n\n\nPersian ice cream sandwich- saffron and cardamom wafers with rose water/saffron/pistachio ice cream\n\n\n\n\n\nDelbar is also amazing- \n\n\nAll of the above but also:\n\n\nDill labneh\n\n\nAdas polo- rice with lentils, raisins, and caramelized onions - the best I have ever had and I‚Äôve had it everywhere \n\n\nStuffed fish- grilled whole fish with a pomegranate walnut stew inside Aladdin in sandy springs (not the Emory one) has the best Arabic food, with Jerusalem bakery a 2nd place. Northern China Eatery on Buford has boiled dumplings that husband said taste just like his mom‚Äôs homemade ones and the Shanghai soup dumplings are better than ones we‚Äôve had in China. \n\nWe also love XiAn Gourmet House inside the JusGo Supermarket up in Duluth. Not quite as flavorful as you might find on the street in XiAn, but their paomo is as close as we‚Äôve found in Atlanta, and their cumin lamb burgers and persimmon cakes are spot on. Bangladeshi:  \nBismillah Cafe! Get some chicken somosas, kaleji (liver) samosas and mutton biryani",

    "chunk_text": "Best bars/restaurants to watch games in Atlanta My birthday is the 12th (tomorrow) and I wanted to watch the NBA Cup game somewhere with a good Hawks crowd. \n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated. \n\nEdit: Here‚Äôs the Hawks Bar network for reference\n\nhttps://www.nba.com/hawks/barnetwork#bars  I mean if we can‚Äôt find one maybe let‚Äôs make a bar the spot? Not sure how many of us actually live here but maybe it‚Äôs enough to show up in numbers and have a good time! I‚Äôve started defaulting to Hudson Grille (little five points). Not a crazy atmosphere but there‚Äôs people in there and lots of TVs. Unfortunately the Hawks do not have a sustained enough culture in Atlanta to draw a crowd for a Tuesday night game in November. You will not find any Hawks centric bars. ¬†There are some bars where you will probably see a handful of hawks people around, those are -¬†\n\nSTATS (downtown)¬†\nDugans (off Ponce)¬†\nBenchwarmers (Decatur)¬†\nSport and Social (the Battery)¬†\n\nAnd some others. ¬†Personally, I like Midway Pub in EAV. ¬†Never tried to watch the Hawks there, though. I honestly dont know of any. A few years ago when the Hawks were in the Conference Finals I went with some friends to 3 Dollar Cafe. They had like 30 TVs, and all were either playing an NFL classic game or showing whatever was on ESPN. We asked to turn it to the Hawks game and it look like 20 minutes for someone to change it. \n\nI would love to find a bar with the atmosphere you see for other teams. Everyone huddled around the tvs cheering or groaning in unison. Manny‚Äôs in Grant Park - Boulevard and Woodward\n. I don't know if it's around anymore but when I would visit my brother we would watch Hawks games at a bar called Sidebar in Downtown not far from Centennial Park. The food was good and they had plenty of TVs. This would be sick. I‚Äôve yelled at my tv alone for too long. Well...someone else mentioned the Hudson Grille in Little 5. That sounds like a good starting point to me. Clays on Roswell Rd is pretty great. I would suggest there. I‚Äôd be down!",

I‚Äôm not sure I understand what you mean? This is a family owned business. They put their heart and soul into this business every single day. I‚Äôve personally seen the owner comp half the dinning rooms tables because the servers didn‚Äôt great their tables with enough enthusiasm. The family that runs this business absolutely love their customers above anything else. Why don‚Äôt you go lookup reviews on Facebook and see for yourself. I feel as though I‚Äôm being authentic because I admitted that I run their marketing. What‚Äôs more authentic than that? I could post in this forum and play games and pretend like I don‚Äôt know the owners. But that would be completely dishonest. As a brand we don‚Äôt operate like that. I simply love soccer and just want to connect fans that love Atlanta United as much as I do. What‚Äôs the harm in that? So again... I honestly don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to insinuate. I don‚Äôt take offense to your statement either. You‚Äôre entitled to express your concerns. Just try to attempt to dig a little deeper before passing judgment.  $8-10 beer and shot combos. Clever names tbd. Possibly a promo for people attending the game later? Darth Vader.  It's a Long Island ice tea but with Jager instead of coke.  You could name it something else though.  Got Buffalo Trace ? Maybe an r/atlantaunited drink special? ; ) you're already called 10, so drinks to celebrate famous #10s\n\n* The Pele - Caiprinha, the classic Brazilian cocktail and still the best all time\n* The Ronaldihno - Carioca, bloody mary made with chachasa instead of vodka\n* The Messi - maybe a cocktail using malbec, or materva (a yerba mate soft drink from argentina)\n* The Maradonna - same as the Messi, but the bartender stirs it with his bare hand\n* The Owen / The Rooney - Carlsberg with a shot of whiskey. \n* The Almiron - Use Atlanta booze, maybe a Lawndart and coke?  I‚Äôve been following your Instagram account for a while and the food, drinks, and atmosphere look amazing. Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had the chance to make a visit, but I‚Äôll definitely be stopping by next gameday!",

    "chunk_text": "Bars/Restaurants to watch the game in or around Duluth, GA Ever since they put all the games on Apple, I haven't been able to find a place to watch the games. Has anyone else had any success finding somewhere that shows the games? Any sports bar that uses Directv as their provider can order MLS Season Pass for $100 for the entire season and the feed is not actually streamed but available via Satellite.\n\nAlso Sunday's match is on big Fox which you can watch with basically a paper clip in the back of your TV... I‚Äôve had similar experiences, but Taco Mac in Roswell had it showing. No but fyi, apple has a very generous family sharing function. I think 6 separate apple IDs can all watch using the same subscription. Not what you‚Äôre looking for but maybe it can help. Taco Mac off Peachtree Industrial usually has it.",

    "chunk_text": "Rest restaurants walking distance to Mercedes Benz Stadium? My husband and I are looking for a nicer restaurant to eat for lunch before a game on Saturday. A lot of the restaurants we‚Äôve been looking at open after 4, which is when the game starts. Does anyone have any recommendations for a bit more upscale restaurant that is walking distance to the stadium and open for lunch? None! There really isn‚Äôt anything upscale that‚Äôs open at lunch. The closest places to the stadium that are closest to your criteria are Ted‚Äôs (next to the Tabernacle) Max‚Äôs Coal Oven or Biergarten. \n\nEverything else is a bar that serves food. Someone will inevitably recommend No Mas but it‚Äôs not that good and crazy expensive for what it is. By George on peachtree is fancy and has brunch til 2:30 on Saturdays. Longer walk or a quick scooter ride to the stadium. I don‚Äôt know how nice it would be considered, but Park Bar has good food and drinks and is walkable! Upscale? Not in the stadium zone. Based on what time you need, I‚Äôd suggest Teds Montana Grill on Luckie. About 8-10 min walk from stadium. I haven‚Äôt had a bad meal there. A bit more upscale varies but I like Hsus Chinese food, Capital Grill, and Alma Covina.  They‚Äôre about a 15 minute walk so pretty easy. I like Bottle Rocket. Upscale sushi spot Closest upscale would be ruth chris or mccormick?\n\nEdit: but those aren‚Äôt open at the time you are looking for I believe. So maybe 4 or 5 star hotels near the stadium would be the best bet Ray's in the City",

    "chunk_text": "Bars/restaurants in Chattanooga that show matches? Any Tennessee/North Georgia friends who know where I can catch the match weekend? Turns out I‚Äôll be at the Benz on Saturday instead ‚Ä¶ but thanks anyway, y‚Äôall. Not sure with the Apple TV. I‚Äôd try a place that has a lot of TVs. I used to watch at BWW or places similar. Check r/Chattanooga, you'll get a good answer. Great soccer community and some ATL sympathizers. Yeah, that Apple TV part is the rub. Worse comes to worse just watch it on your phone or tablet at a bar. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
