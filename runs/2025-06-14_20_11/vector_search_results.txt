  Text: Will this Idea work ? Today, I ran into a real problem — and it got me thinking about building something to fix it. I’d love to get your thoughts.

Some friends dragged me out to a Chinese restaurant for dinner. Honestly, I wasn’t in the mood to eat outside food, and to make things worse, I had no idea what to order. The menu was filled with dishes I didn’t recognize, and I wasn’t sure what to order.

That’s when an idea struck me — what if there was a tool or app that could help decode the menu? Something that explains what each dish is, how it’s prepared, what ingredients go into it, and maybe even helps me choose something based on my current mood or taste preference, additionally getting the restaurant name from me and say what is the top rated food in that resturant by checking online reviews.

I know I can upload the menu to ChatGPT and get some explanation, but I’m thinking of something smarter — something that understands my taste over time and helps me make better choices in the future too.

Do you think building something like this would actually work? Would people use it? Will this app or tool survive?

  Text: Your SaaS probably shouldn't exist. I will not promote Gonna piss some people off but someone needs to say it. I talk to 3-5 SaaS founders every week 80% are building solutions to problems that don't really exist

We're like Slack but for restaurants, think Notion but specifically for real estate agents, it's basically Calendly but with AI. Man you need to stop, not everybody should have his own startup, do smth else.

You know what successful founders tell me? Customers were literally begging us to build this

Not I think restaurants would like better communication. Asking for the solution ss in, they tried everything else and nothing worked.

I worked with a founder last year who built construction project management software. Not because he thought construction needed better software (it obviously does), but because he ran a construction company for 10 years,tried every existing tool,none solved his actual workflow problems, his crew was literally using WhatsApp and Excel, other contractors kept asking what system he was building.

That's product-market fit before you even build.

Compare that to founders who saw a market opportunity on some blog post, thought they could do X but better, built for a problem they read about but never experienced, are shocked when users don't care

Your market research isn't listening to podcasts about TAM. It's having customers throw money at you to solve their pain

If you can't name 10 people who would pay for your solution TODAY, you probably shouldn't build it

Do something else and usually these people assume that they will make it happen but after spending some time and money see it as a waste of time.

And as someone who used it previously (not that I was a big fan of it) I started thinking why people would have used it. I recently moved abroad for higher education and as an introvert it has been difficult making friends that are local. As someone who prefers to text and someone working on keeping a conversation going, I realized I needed help with it. I would much rather talk to another real person than an AI chatbot. So I got thinking, maybe a one to one messaging app that connects you with a random person in the same city/ local area every week with the goal of getting to know each other and making friends. The app's primary audience is introverts that struggle to make or keep a conversation going just like me. And to help them the app would feature an AI assistant that would read the last few messages with the other person and suggests follow-ups for the user to type to keep the chat going. The app could also feature a "third-place finder" that helps the user find places to meet in-person. The recommendation is based on the messages. Example: if the user says "would like to have a coffee together and talk more" and if the other person agrees, a box on the chat window appears showing nearby coffee shops.

Hopefully the idea comes across well. What do you guys think? Is this a tarpit idea or a problem you have faced or know someone who faces it? This is not a promotion and I will not promote.

  Text: Building a non-exploitative AI tool for restaurant kitchens — looking for feedback from this community I’m a former line cook who transitioned into tech, and I’m currently building a project called MEP (short for mise en place) with a scheduling frontend named Flo. The goal is to support restaurant teams—especially back-of-house crews—with shift coverage, prep coordination, and onboarding in a way that genuinely respects workers instead of surveilling them.

This isn’t automation for automation’s sake. It’s not about cutting labor costs or optimizing people into exhaustion. It’s about designing a simple, AI-assisted system that helps small, chaotic teams stay organized—without adding more stress or complexity to already difficult jobs. Having worked in kitchens that used systems like HotSchedules and 7shifts, I’ve seen firsthand how these platforms prioritize management needs while making day-to-day work harder for the people actually on the line.

MEP is meant to do the opposite. It helps assign roles based on real-world context like skill level, fatigue, and task flow—not just raw availability. It can offer onboarding prompts or prep walkthroughs for new cooks during service. Most importantly, it avoids invasive data collection, keeps all AI suggestions overrideable by humans, and pushes for explainability rather than black-box logic.

I’m sharing this here because I want real feedback—not hype. I’m curious how folks in this community think about building AI for environments that are inherently messy, human, and full of unquantifiable nuance. What risks am I not seeing here? What are the ethical or technical red flags I should be more aware of? And do you think AI belongs in this kind of space at all?

This isn’t a startup pitch. I’m not selling anything. I just want to build something my former coworkers would actually want to use—and I want to build it responsibly. Any insights are welcome, especially if you’ve worked on systems in similarly high-stakes, high-pressure fields.

Thanks for your time.

\*I pass **normalised** embeddings into Triplet—conceptually wrong (distance loss wants raw vectors) but it happens to work.

# Working hypotheses

1. **Objective mismatch** \- BPR expects unbounded score gaps, while cosine squeezes them into \[-1, 1\], killing gradients.
2. **Pair weighting** \- Triplet punishes the hardest negatives; BPR treats all pairs equally.
3. **Margin as scale knob** \- 0.1 matches cosine range; 1.0 overshoots and wrecks ranking.
4. **Regularisation overlap** \- L2-norm already constrains vector length; BPR might need temperature scaling or un-normalised embeddings.

# Open questions

* Has anyone rescued **BPR** with cosine scores (e.g., by temperature or score scaling)?
* For small catalogues with strong hard negatives, is **Triplet/InfoNCE** the safer default now?
* Any success with **hybrid losses** (Triplet + BPR or softmax-CE)?
* Other ranking-first losses worth trying in this setting?

I'm finishing building a social discovery app and would love feedback from fellow entrepreneurs on the business opportunity.

**The market problem:** Gen Z is abandoning traditional nightlife (UK loses one club every two days), while 61% say social apps lack authenticity. Venues struggle with digital engagement that translates to real footfall.

**The solution:** Social discovery platform requiring physical venue verification via QR flyers or NFC tags to unlock features. Users build visible gaming profiles through badges and levels earned from matches, check-ins, and social activities. Connection requests are limited to verified users at the same venue. Privacy-first approach shows only profile photos and name initials until users match and exchange three messages, gradually revealing full information.

**Revenue plan:**

* Consumer subscriptions (Free to $50/month tiers)
* Venue partnerships ($200-1000/month for analytics + engagement tools)
* Transaction fees from in-app purchases and drink sending
* Future AR gaming with real-world rewards

**Why this could scale:** Venues get accurate customer data + increased engagement. Users get authentic connections + gamified social experience. Strong network effects once critical mass is reached.

**Questions:**

1. Is the venue partnership sales cycle manageable for a startup?
2. Can gamification create enough stickiness to compete with big tech?
3. What's the realistic timeline to prove unit economics?
4. Any experience monetizing two-sided gaming platforms?

**Biggest risks:**

* Chicken-egg adoption problem
* User behavior change required
* Big tech copying the concept once it gains traction

Looking for honest assessment - is this a scalable business or am I chasing a niche? Any insights on similar ventures?

3. **UX must be strong**, with a design that presents information well and leads to conversion. Conversion is essential, pages must be designed to convert.  
4. **Mobile optimized design**. 70% of our traffic is now from mobile, the entire site must work flawlessly, maintain great UX, and maintain strong conversion on mobile devices.   
5. **We'd like to work with intuitive designers**. It's a bonus if we work with someone who has prior experience designing healthcare service business sites, but not mandatory. We want developers who suggest things we haven't considered. E.g. If you see several blogs on the topic of \[topic\], you proactively suggest creating the option to filter blogs by \[that topic\].

  Text: how an SF series b startup teaches Cursor to remember every code review comment talked to some engineers at parabola (data automation company) and they showed me this workflow that's honestly pretty clever. 

instead of repeating the same code review comments over and over, they write "cursor rules" that teach the ai to automatically avoid those patterns. 

basically works like this: every time someone leaves a code review comment like "hey we use our orm helper here, not raw sql" or "remember to preserve comments when refactoring", they turn it into a plain english rule that cursor follows automatically. 

**couple examples they shared:**

    Comment Rules: when doing a large change or refactoring, try to retain comments, possibly revising them, or matching the same level of commentary to describe the new systems you're building
    
    Package Usage: If you're adding a new package, think to yourself, "can I reuse an existing package instead" (Especially if it's for testing, or internal-only purposes)

the rules go in a .cursorrules file in the repo root and apply to all ai-generated code. 

after \~10 prs they said they have this collection of team wisdom that new ai code automatically follows. 

**what's cool about it:** 

**-** catches the "we don't do it that way here" stuff 

\- knowledge doesn't disappear when people leave

\- way easier than writing custom linter rules for subjective stuff 

**downsides:** 

\- only works if everyone uses cursor (or you maintain multiple rule formats for different ides) 

\- rules can get messy without discipline

\- still need regular code review, just less repetitive 

tried it on my own project and honestly it's pretty satisfying watching the ai avoid mistakes that used to require manual comments. 

not groundbreaking but definitely useful if your team already uses cursor. 

anyone else doing something similar? curious what rules have been most effective for other teams.

• others join based on skills, interests, or just curiosity
•people actually team up to build, without the cringe networking part

  Text: Multinational corporation loved the product, wanted me to come to their office to present in person, then ghosted when they found out I was one person I frequently post examples of what my business does on LinkedIn and I recently got a connection request from the director of an international restaurant chain, that you would all likely have heard of. I sent him some example analysis in my first message and he said that he saw my post and was looking for a solution like this.

We then had a video call where I went through some example analysis of 25 of their locations, they have hundreds of locations in my country. There were a few other people from the team on the call with this person.

I went through the product, we discussed ideas and potential feature requests and they said that they were looking to partner with someone to develop a product that suits their needs, which I said that I could do. They then asked about my personal background, trying to get to know me. I was fully honest and said that I was an engineer, then business development person, then taught myself programming in the last year, then came up with the idea and built the product.

They were impressed by the product and said that they wanted me to come to their office in person at a specific date and time next week and they would send me the address (I found it online anyway). They also requested some additional features and asked if I could analyse more of their locations for the meeting. I did all of this, spending a couple days working on this (it benefited the product as well) and spending my own money to run the analysis, tokens are not cheap. But then they ghosted me, I sent them some sample analysis on email, messaged on LinkedIn and also phoned their office on the day of the supposed meeting to get clarification on if it was going ahead.

Completely ghosted, which I thought was extremely disrespectful. The only guess that I have as to why is that they saw me as 1 person, unestablished business, which is true. But, my product is all automated, it works, also I can build quicker than any large established business and of course I have basically no overheads.

I remember from my previous job in business development at a medium sized company that our managing director said that we can present ourselves to be as large as we want to be, not lying, but by how we present the company and conduct ourselves, e.g. when talking to large corporations. In future, I will not be so open and forthcoming with my exact personal details and maybe present it in a better way, I could even say that some of my friends and family members, who I do consult, are part of the company.

Honestly, I don't think that the average person understands how much you can do by leveraging the tools available today. I don't need a team of developers, an HR person, an accounts team. Everything is automated and I can code a product and new features 10x faster than established companies. The product is pretty simple, it's a monthly subscription so if they don't like it then they can stop paying. I can even refund people if they really have a problem with it.

Categorizations, similarity (complex documents), clustering, etc. Accuracy isn't great but it let's us do a lot of work very cheaply.

We've ran some experiments on fine-tuning an embeddings model to improve accuracy but the gains were minimal. We know we can get this higher accuracy with larger models, 7B is much better but that's much slower and more expensive then what we see with a 500M model.

We've been debating if the disparity of tasks that most models are trained on is one of the limiting factors to accuracy. Does the model need learn multiple tasks or will it improve if we keep it focused on one narrowly defined (although complex) task. 

We have millions of examples that we can use for training. Which leaves us wondering can we get past the 70% accuracy we're seeing today with the best OWM. We train our own models all the time but we haven't built an embeddings model from scratch. Would really love to hear from someone who has.

Also if you have depth of knowledge with embeddings or other models like rerankers and have other recommendations would love to hear those as well.

  Text: cursor users: stop letting it learn from random code. use "gold standard files" instead so i was talking to this engineer from a series B startup in SF (Pallet) and he told me about this cursor technique that actually fixed their ai code quality issues. thought you guys might find it useful.

basically instead of letting cursor learn from random internet code, you show it examples of your actual good code. they call it "gold standard files."

**how it works:**

1. pick your best controller file, service file, test file (whatever patterns you use)
2. reference them directly in your \`.cursorrules\` file
3. tell cursor to follow those patterns exactly

here's what their cursor rules looks like:

    You are an expert software engineer. 
    Reference these gold standard files for patterns:
    - Controllers: /src/controllers/orders.controller.ts
    - Services: /src/services/orders.service.ts  
    - Tests: /src/tests/orders.test.ts
    
    Follow these patterns exactly. Don't change existing implementations unless asked.
    Use our existing utilities instead of writing new ones.

**what changes:**

the ai stops pulling random patterns from github and starts following *your* patterns, which means:

* new ai code looks like their senior engineers wrote it
* dev velocity increased without sacrificing quality
* code consistency improved

**practical tips:**

* start with one pattern (like api endpoints), add more later
* don't overprovide context - too many instructions confuse the ai
* share your cursor rules file with the whole team via git
* pick files that were manually written by your best engineers

**the key insight:** "don't let ai guess what good code looks like. show it explicitly."

anyone else tried something like this? curious about other cursor workflow improvements.

After several hiring cycles in a remote-first setup, I've noticed a recurring issue: great candidates sometimes get filtered out too early in the screening phase, while other times, too much time is spent engaging candidates who turn out to be a poor fit.

At first, I thought this was just a recruiting agency issue, but it feels more like a systemic flaw in how remote hiring works. Add in AI-generated resumes, portfolios, and even interview answers, and it's getting harder to tell what’s real - especially without the nuance of in-person interaction.

Curious how other founders or early-stage teams are handling this. How do you evaluate candidates and their work in a distributed environment? Would appreciate any insights or frameworks you've found useful.



1. How often do you encounter candidates who misrepresent their skills or experience?
2. What's the cost (time or money) of interviewing or hiring someone who ends up being underqualified or dishonest?
3. Do you trust resumes and portfolios as they are today? Why or why not?
4. How appealing would it be if candidates were pre-vetted using a mix of AI tools and trusted experienced developers before they got to you?
5. Would you trust candidates more if they could prove they had real access to a project's live site - like showing a simple, technical way to confirm they actually worked on it?
6. Would you pay to access verified, reviewed, hire-ready candidates? If so, how much feels fair (per hire or per month)?
7. How does this compare to services you already use (LinkedIn, job boards, ATS, etc.)?

I never understood the advice of, "just read the documentation",  SPECIFICALLY towards beginners. Never worked for me. I feel like I've learned better and more effectively through having a MAIN course for something I want to learn and documentation as a SIDE-RESOURCE that I use to refresh my memory or learn new concepts quickly for a technology I'm already comfortable with. I want to learn the bigger picture, not just learn the modules in Node, and I feel like courses are great at explaining WHY something works and in what situations it is best in. I believe this is why I've enjoyed The Odin Project so much even though they heavily push on reading documentation. They don't just send you the link to JavaScript.info and tell you to read the whole thing, they give you little bits and pieces from the website and other websites for you to learn that specific concept and in their article they teach you the bigger picture of why you're even learning said concept and why the resources they're linking are good resources.

Now, this is not to say that MDN, JavaScript.info, W3Schools and other websites are bad resources. I just feel like if my friend tells me tomorrow, "Hey I want to learn HTML". I wouldn't just tell them to download VSCode and read W3Schools. I'd give them different options like freeCodeCamp, programming with mosh's video, udemy courses, etc, and then they can read MDN to refresh their memory or revise new concepts. Or I'd ask them what their preferred method of learning is and we go from there.

At the end of the day, not everyone is going to feel comfortable learning the same way. Which is why we should keep that in mind and not tell the beginner, "just dive in and read MDN when you get lost". I feel like a lot of documentation out there isn't very beginner friendly, or doesn't go slow enough for that person to grasp the why's and how's of that technology.
