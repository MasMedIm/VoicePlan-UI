  Text: My startup went viral after making a commercial using AI from barely 37 signups... to friggin 11K

i actually can’t believe it... i literally just wanted to satisfy my creative side so i decided to let myself have some fun with VEO-3 and Capcut. i liked what i ended up getting, and decided to post it on a couple discords im active in and on twitter and woke up to it blowing up. i could have never have done this 3 years ago.

i think the context plays a big part. my startup is called humanet and it is supposed to be a 100% human only social media, which means there will be no bots/spam/ai slop. i made it because a lot of the old online spaces i used to enjoy got overridden by ai agents/bots that just talk to eachother endlessly and it depressed me. so i made my commercial about how ai is going to take over the internet. i have gotten a lot of really great feedback!!!!!

if i have any advice for new startup founders, it is to utilize ALLLLL the resources you can. every single one. until recently, i thought this was the worst time to be a startup founder. IM WRONG. ITS THE BEST TIME. YOU CAN MAKE SICK ASS ADS IN ONE SINGLE DAY :D

  Text: AI coding to launch MVP/prototypes quickly (I will not promote) A MVP/Prototype, of say a mobile app, helps us (early stage startups) quickly validate the solution and iterate. While AI coding makes it fast, but unreliable code is predominant. Some of the below steps help get functional prototypes done faster and with high quality

* Setup rules/instructions detailing about the code structure & standards you need
* Use PRD or feed project specs to AI using images, textual requirements through prompts. Recommendation is to use this for simple to medium complexity
* Have AI use a checklist, memory file if it's weak on context setting
* Review every logic generated by AI
* Look for deprecated packages and use prompts to update them or manually fix the same
* To maintain stability of existing code, either break down the ask into multiple prompts fixated on context or vibe code with AI tools that are good at using context
* For complex logic, manually code

Curious to know how have others accelerated coding to quickly launch their products?

  Text: $15k in marketing services (for free) I'm part of a small creative agency based in Montreal, and we’ve worked with a lot of early-stage businesses over the years. One thing we’ve seen over and over again: amazing founders doing great work, but held back by branding or websites that don’t really reflect who they are or where they’re headed.

So we decided to give back and launch something called Launchpad.

We’re selecting one startup to receive a full rebrand + website, completely free. It includes brand strategy, visual identity, and creative direction, basically everything we’d do for a paid client, just without the invoice.

We’re doing this because we genuinely want to support someone doing meaningful work who hasn’t had the chance to invest in this side of their business yet.

If that’s you (or someone in your network) send me a DM and I can send over the guidelines & application. 

Happy to answer any questions, or even just talk branding or websites if you're figuring that part out. Hope this helps someone here.

  Text: Built and launched my second startup. Solo. This stuff is hard Hey ya'll,

Just wanted to tell ya'll about my path as I grow my startup.

I'm currently a freshman in college, and I've been trying to build things to get my foot in the door in entrepreneurship and become the next person on Starter Story lol.

But it's been difficult. First startup was Handwritio, an AI app that extracts text from bad handwriting. Spent 3 WHOLE MONTHS building it with no marketing.( yeah I know, pretty dumb) Found out ChatGPT does that, so I swallowed my pride and moved forward lmao.

Now I'm building Examlectica, an AI app that generates you quizzes, flashcards, and summaries when you upload study documents. Thing is, I wanted this time to build an SLC framework instead of an MVP. Thought it would take me a week. I ended up working for 6hrs+/day for a month lol. No waitlist, again(Ill learn eventually lol) I've felt a type of tired I've never felt before haha.

Check out the 1 month build here: [https://examlectica.vercel.app](https://examlectica.vercel.app)  
Go ahead and give me some feedback. Would appreciate it.

Wanted to ask ya'll how your second startup was for you, what you learned and if you feel burnt out like I do. Imma try to iterate on this to see if it has potential.

  Text: Updated my simple (and free) Reddit keyword tool Built (yet another, but free) tool yesterday to find relevant reddit posts to promote/market research, etc. It got way more traction than I expected. Around 400 people used it and I got lots (really!) of thank you messages and people saying it's helping them.  
  
I want to develop the tool further and just added a new feature: optional (!) AI-powered ranking. It tries to understand what you're actually looking for (not only by the keywords) and ranks results by relevance. Still experimental and a bit slow, but works.  
  
It's 100% free. I'd really appreciate any feedback, especially on the AI part.  
  
Also just started a Discord to collect feedbacks, share ideas, and chat with other building stuff:
