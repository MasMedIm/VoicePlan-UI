I haven't seen too many around, but I like the one from Revolution Donuts. They also have lavender syrup, so I like to make it a lavender London Fog. 💜 Rev Coffee in Smyrna is on my wife’s list as well. I've found they can be really hit or miss everywhere. Which is wild to me since they aren't a complex drink. I've had a good one at Corner Cup (Decatur and Tucker area). Love the one at Coffee Man on the west side. I think the one at San Fransisco coffee is pretty good. I’m curious about this too! I’ve had good ones at Press & Grind, but it seems like it depends on the barista’s skill - they can be hit or miss. Kula coffee co in buckhead 🥳 Little Tart makes a yummy one! As a London Fog fanatic, Little tart makes the BEST- across the way Salted Donuts is pretty good. Revolution donut is great!

Thinking of those who have lost their dad or have a less than stellar dad. Thinking of hitting the Reptile Expo. I’ve lived in Atlanta for over a decade and never been. Did anyone go yesterday? I just woke up with a cold and thus will spend the rest of the day laying around in dramatic poses like a Victorian aristocrat painting. Happy Fathers Day to all you MFers out there It’s my wife’s bday! She requested a casual patio somewhere this evening so long as the rain holds off. Any recs? I wish it would stop raining so I can catch up on yardwork 😭 Morning peeps and Happy Father’s Day! I am thinking about moving to the Camp Creek Marketplace area and would love to hear from anyone who commutes from there to Midtown Atlanta. Could you share how long your daily commute takes and what time you usually leave? Especially when school is in session. Thanks!\n\nI was unable to make a post about this as mods requested I ask the question in daily discussion since it involves commuting. It's only 10:30 and I've already gone over my calorie burn goal by like 100. This is great because I fully intend to spend the afternoon on the couch \n\nHappy Sunday everyone. If you plan on fighting the humidity, I believe in you. Just make sure you hydrate Where are your favorite places to work from that will let you bring your dog? Hoping to find somewhere that isn't completely rambunctious (like fetch) as she's skittish. Bonus points if it has an inside area with AC",

Even though I clearly communicated to them that I required someone who knew what they were doing, they booked me with idiot girl who spent 2 sessions (several hundred bucks a piece and I'm self-pay) basically doing nothing beyond sitting there with her maw hanging open while she listened to me dump out all my trauma and cry. Each time I left feeling much worse than whenever I arrived and she never followed through with any of the things that she said she was going to do. After my second session I was pissed and went to look her up on the licensing website and that's where I found out that she was still under supervision and the ink had barely dried on her diploma. Fuck that \n\n\nDo not go to East Atlanta counseling center.\n\nFwiw, I ended up making a complaint to the licensing board, East Atlanta Counseling refunded my money because they knew damn well they'd messed up.

    "chunk_text": "Where can I buy a rhubarb pie in or around Atlanta? Looking for places where I could buy a rhubarb or strawberry rhubarb pie  Rhubarb season is over in zones 7a/7b, particularly with what a wet May we had (7\" total).  There may be a few slim holdouts, but any pie you get now will be from canned or processed rhubarb. \n\nordinarily with most fruit pies i'd say \"who cares go for it\" regarding processed fruits but rhubarb is something different altogether. wait until next year unless you can confirm a very late crop fresh rhubarb pie.  [https://www.southernbakedpie.com](https://www.southernbakedpie.com) \\- they do requests. They're in vinings. The Fresh Market chain usually has rhubarb pie Osono Bread at the Grant Park Farmers Market Sprouts had frozen rhubarb if you're interested in making one. (This is my favorite pie btw, good luck to you!) Pies by Julie @atlpiesbyjulie\n\nhttps://pies-by-julie.myshopify.com/?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwK67u5leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp26diBF9rPzxoX0P2AB5ZBtT_LBuOEV-YVShFV63468uDZ_Mxyj4uWF9RoZH_aem_y_C1GqiBDcApverlLwIAGA Fresh market is the only grocer I can find who sometimes carries a strawberry rhubarb pie. Call the bakery and ask when they will have them. They aren't seasonal. They just show up whenever.\n\nIf you want to try your hand at it, buy frozen rhubarb at Sprouts or even fresh and add some organic strawberries and sugar. It's an easy recipe but I made it too sweet and missed the tart of the rhubarb.\n\nThey're so good! I think Pies By Julie had them last week, not sure about coming up though. Maybe little tart bake shop? Got a strawberry-rhubarb at Mercier Orchards 3 weeks ago but maybe they're out. No idea how fresh it was. Their pies are goated though and they have like 20 flavors at any kind point and they're all delicious.",

    "chunk_text": "Bike shop recommendations? Hey there folks! I’m looking to restore my father’s old bicycle. Is there a bike shop you’d recommend? Ideally close to a Marta station but that’s not a big priority.  Loose nuts in grant park. Owner operated. There are a lot of good options in the city. Loose nuts is my favorite. Outback bikes are also great and closer to a marta station. Just a heads up, most good shops will try to talk you out of doing any kind of major work to an older bike.  It's just not worth the cost of parts plus labor compared to just buying a new bike.  I'm not saying they won't do it, but be prepared to pay up front.  Bike shops often get in these situations, order the parts, do the work, then the bike never gets picked up when the customer find out how much they actually owe.  \n\nBut yes, Loose Nuts are good folk. I just had my gear hub taken apart and re-tooled at Peachtree Bikes on N. Decatur and they were really quick and affordable. Great communication when they realized it was going to take a little more $ than originally quoted. Big peach midtown! Big peach is close to the midtown station and good Rei is literally next to the Sandy Springs Marta \n\nWhat’s the bike ? Loose Nuts gets all of my business. Always LNC. Best shop in the city. Sweet. I really just need a stuck seat post replaced and new wheels/tires. I should be able to do the rest since it’s not it too bad of a condition. It would just be cool to have a spot I can check out.",

We’re driving down from Chattanooga. I’m trying to figure out if there is a good MARTA station to park at that’s out of the city a bit and ride in. Then when we leave after, we ride back out and we’ll miss some of the traffic (in theory). Good idea or bad idea? Found some cool stuff at Scott Antique Market today. A couple of cool pieces of jewelry from a vendor I call Silver Lady 😆, and an intricate glass bowl from the vendor I call The Glass Lady 😆.\n\nHad some luck at the thrift store, too. I kind of want to start my own little side decor business. Yeah they are extra awful this year. Nothing seems to help in our yard this year either. Buckets with mosquito dunks, some other traps I bought etc.  Shit sucks. I've always been a mosquito magnet my whole life. I've added B1 and garlic supplements and it seems to be helping. Definitely not 100% reduction, but much less than I'm used to in the past. The genius that planted bamboo in my backyard (which helps breed mosquitoes) needs to step on a Lego barefoot.  I will say The Local has FANTASTIC wings and is dive-y. Big and juicy, and they got pretty good hot dogs and boiled peanuts too!",

    "chunk_text": "What’s your favorite park? Thinking of spending more time walking and reading in parks this summer. What’s your favorite park in our beautiful city in the forest? Hiking trails also appreciated! It’s basic but you can’t beat piedmont it’s so big you can always find something new to see I've been heavily exploring the city by bike for the past 5 months and I feel like my favorite things I didn't expect were the west side reservoir, the west side beltline, Oakland cemetery, and the Adair parks. Also, freedom park had always somehow been invisible to me but makes for a great connection between downtown and the beltline.\n\nAlso, if you like outdoor pools Mozley Park is pretty nice. It's surrounded by trees and is splendid. Popular with kids but all ages are there and it's a vibe like every day it's open.\n\nEDIT: Ooh, I forgot, the Kirkwood Urban Forest Preserve was completely random and very easy to miss on a map but makes for a pretty nice walk. It's small but once you're inside you can find a nice bench and pretend you're in a forest miles from Atlanta. Same with westside resevoire honestly. I really love Grant Park. Lots of green space and the south east corner of it has a great view of the city. I genuinely love Historic Fourth Ward Park. It's busier and louder than a lot of other parks but it's maintained well and there are places that are quieter. big fan of parking at medlock park north of decatur and walking the south peachtree creek trail! it's a beautiful trail and very well maintained with some great spots to sit :) Oakland Cemetery Most of my favs have been mentioned but\n\n1) East Palisades. Go find the bamboo forest. It's magical.\n\n2) Morningside nature preserve- I've lived in Atlanta for years and I didn't discover this until 2020. And they have a mini bamboo forest too.\n\n3) Lionel Hampton Trail is mostly shaded so that's nice.\n\n4) Hahn woods. Um, if you are attentive, there's a way to walk to Lullwater Park from here. \n\n5) Speaking of which, Lullwater Park is magical too. You'd never expect that in the middle of Atlanta\n\n6) I have a soft spot for Grant Park. You can watch the elephants for free up on the grassy part of the parking deck. The meadow is good for picnics.\n\n7) DH Stanton Park is a hidden gym. It's got a great splash pad not many know about.\n\n8) Rodney Cook Park is beautiful.\n\n9) don't sleep on Westside park. It's relatively new and huge.\n\n10) cascade springs nature preserve is pretty interesting. If you visit, lemme know if you see the Santeria offerings. They were there the last couple times I visited Sweetwater creek state park I-20 west right past Six Flags. It is great if you wanna go outside downtown and it is close. Great hiking trails and a great big creek you can sit on the flat rocks in the water too off the hiking trails. Doll’s Head Trail. Weird, beautiful, peaceful. Also, muddy after a rain. It is of course Cochran Shoals. The real ones know.",

I train somewhat seriously for races and would love to find a group of people who are also aiming to train hard and maybe even be locally competitive.\n Atlanta track club Generally if you’re running sub 15 or 16 5k’s, you’re going to have to run by yourself since there’s a really small number of people who run times like those in general. I came to that conclusion to just training by yourself but run long distances socially. My 5k’s are sub 16 What's your pace normally? Besides ATC there is also an Atlanta Race Camp by the Atlanta Run Club that I’ve seen some people mention on Strava Agree that it depends on the types of runs you’re looking to do (tempos, thresholds, track intervals, standard training runs) and your pace in them. Atlanta Track Club (ATC) probably suits your sensibilities the most. There are a few run clubs in the city that feel like performative clout chasers. Atlanta Track Club, all the way! I love the community that I’ve built (I run with the Armory location at ATC headquarters). It’s definitely a great club for serious runners of all levels, and I love their training programs for half-marathons/marathons and the Peachtree Road Race. Plus, the Atlanta Track Club organizes great 5ks and 10ks and half/full marathons throughout the year that you get a discount on as a member (I’ve also had bad experiences with 5ks NOT organized by ATC.) can’t recommend them enough. Try the Nike Mondays at PCM, I think the proper name is Atlanta Run Club. Some of those folks are blazing fast. Inquire about the Atlanta Track Club Open Team (or Masters if older)",

Ya know…I was gonna bitch about the rain a bit, but then I saw the other comment positivity and decided against it. So I won’t say anything about how annoying these daily downpours have been and how I can remember the last full day of sun we had. Gahhhh all this positivity on the daily thread. We see you Fred Blankenship Y’all be safe this weekend. Sending you all some love and sunshine. Get out there today and kick a little ass. \nMy husband and I are childfree for the night for the first time since 2019. Big plans to hit the town tonight, trying hard not to act our ages and give into the urge to stay home. Let's make some noise this weekend folks!!! \n🚫👑 Been on a journey trying out coffee beans from all the local shops.  I'm on Postern right now which might be my favorite so far!  Up next is Perc.  They apparently have a monthly sale every 13th (today) where everything is 31% off so ordered a few bags. Today we're only being positive on here? I love this and hope everyone has a lovely day. Buying an eBike 2 weeks ago to 'stay in shape' was a decision that this rain has made me regret.\n\nEmbracing the positivity today, I'm gonna go ride the Comet today even if it IS RAINING.

I’m looking for options for beautiful stone for a kitchen. Help!  IKEA did my quartzite and it slaps… so you don’t have to break the bank.\n\nIf money were no object though, I’d find some guys to do a labradorite counter. You definitely don't want marble if you're looking at countertops. Even more so if you plan on cooking a lot. It stains and is damaged easily. https://thestonegal.com/\n I’ve used her twice for kitchen and bathroom. She lets you tour stone yards or sends you lots of options. We chose a Brazilian green veined marble for our kitchen. The price was better than what quartz people were quoting us. AGM Imports in Norcross has a huge inventory.\n\nAlso Legacy Countertops in Alpharetta has a much smaller inventory, but mentioning because I had an excellent install experience. And they happened to have a unusual quartzite that exactly fit my needs. I can't remember if we got our fancy quartz countertops here or just the tile. https://www.tileshop.com/tile CIOT on in West Midtown has high end slabs. You’ll need to work with a designer and fabricator though to get access to them. Cosentino in buckhead Inman Stone and Marble installed marble throughout our kitchen. They have a sealer that makes it so we can wipe away anything we spill on it. Wine, coffee, pasta sauce, all gone with no issue.",

    "chunk_text": "Boarding for elderly dog with health issues I am looking for a vet or boarding situation for my elderly dog with health issues. She has IBD (irritable bowel disease) but does seem controlled with medicine . The problem is she needs to go outside every 3 to 4 hours. I have to go away and am beside myself with how to board her . I called the place I normally board her and they asked if she could have diarrhea and I can’t  promise she won’t be in a different scary situation .   It is controlled at home. She is a good sweet natured dog with some health issues. Does anyone know of a “special needs” boarding situation in Atlanta (ITP)? You may be better off looking for in home care. These days it's not much of a price difference.\n\nRover is a start. If you know anyone who does it or other owners who can give you a referral, that's better I would look into someone who could come stay at your home with her. We did that for my dog for the last 4-5 years of his life. He didn’t have many health issues but he was very large and was less anxious at home.\n\nPrice wise it’s honestly comparable to most decent boarding services. I'd reach out to [Big Redd Dog Petsitting](https://bigredddogpetsitti.wixsite.com/big-redd-dog-pet) \\- they have a lot of sitters who are experienced volunteers with the local shelters.  Many board at their homes so you don't have to have someone stay at yours. I know a great pet sitting business. Very caring. Hello! I know you said you are not super interested in people coming to your house, but my pet sitter does an amazing job and specializes in special needs animals. If you change your mind, here is their contact info with the option to request service. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/allcreaturesatl/ If you're in Decatur or Avondale Estates, [ManyPaws Pet Sitting](https://manypawspetsitting.com/) is a good option. They stayed in our home with our dog a couple of times and did a great job caring for him and keeping us updated on his status. Sent you a direct message to your inbox Honestly, your best bet is to call some of the ones that get recommended here.  We board our dogs at Central Bark, and one of our dogs is elderly with heart disease, and they do a fantastic job in caring for her.  That said, I can't speak to how they would handle an elderly dog with IBD.\n\nI think your best bet is just to be very clear with your dog's current medical situation and any reputable place will give you an honest answer. https://www.trustedhousesitters.com I only do in home. Buckhead pet pals and Village Pets are both wonderful!",

    "chunk_text": "ADHD Evaluation Does anyone have recommendations for metro Atlanta providers/clinics that perform ADHD assessments and take insurance? Bonus if it’s a woman or just any provider that women have had good experiences with. Thanks in advance!  Scarlet Hurtnole @ Atlanta Integrative Psychiatry\n\nVery professional and down to earth. Doesn’t talk over you. Very attentive.\n\nOffers remote and on-site Dr Donielle Fagan I’m going to shout out to Brennan at Beal Wellness in East Point. The office is very much a local clinic vibe, not pretentious, and Brennan is fairly young and not overly-masculine. First visit would be in person, subsequent visits can be remote. Dr. Beal seems nice as well but the front desk suggested that Brennan was more progressive and in touch in some ways, when I asked them.\n\nThis isn’t a corporate-owned psychiatrist office, there are ways in which it is clear they have their priorities straight. Lifestance health they’re lovely. I specifically see Dr. Pulliam she’s great but they all are in that Brookhaven office I got to MindBodySoul in Decatur. The assessment itself isn't covered by insurance, but the appointments, meds, all that are. But to be honest with you, after a few meetings with Dr. Judith, she's told me i absolutely have adhd and we've been working together on finding the best medication for me, without having taken the assessment. Brandi Wells takes BCBS. Most evaluators don’t take insurance. Not sure how far north you’re willing to go but I just had my daughter evaluated (and am most likely going to have myself evaluated) at Fresh Start for the Mind. I went to the Canton office but I believe they have another one in Suwanee. They took our Anthem BCBS and we only have seen females there. It’s female and minority owned actually! Super easy process so far! The Neuropsychiatric Clinic of Atlantis.  I was able to see them remote and it was a female provider, very positive experience. I have Kaiser, and while I had to push my primary for the referral to get the assessment, the assessments did not cost me out of pocket at all. \n\nI do have to pay per session with my Psychiatrist, my specialist copay amount, and we do that about every 3 months. But I think thats more related to my history with depression Doctor Vallurupalli is a super awesome psychiatrist who really takes the time to fully explain how our brains work with ADHD and is heavily invested in continously learning more and more about the condition.",

Why is it so expensive? Also, what are the negative impacts of the elevated walkways on downtown street life? I never paid any mind to them from the outside, and they’re convenient when you’re inside and need to get to the other building. Other than them apparently being super expensive lol Yeah, that is hilarious, trying to write an \"article\" for people with tiktok brains that wouldn't be reading in the first place It’s Axios’ writing style for all their articles. They call it “Smart Brevity”, the founder wrote a whole book on its merits to convey messaging.  They started out as an email newsletter, and it really makes sense in that context. \n\nLike it or not, at least they have a reason and are consistent. I personally kind of prefer it for shorter articles like this. If it wasn't written by AI, they tried their hardest to make it appear so I am so sure this was written by AI Stupid, ignorant comment.\n\nThis has always been Axios' style guide, and it works. You should be getting your news from multiple sources anyways, Axios included. They all have different style guides.

My weather app must be out of sync. 72? With humidity I was thinking it was 92. Gonna be a looong summer. I should really get a roommate, but gosh having someone living in my space seems so daunting. Do I want money and more social interaction or do I want to be a feral goblin in peace? A few weeks ago I missed the deadline to book within the room block for a wedding I'm attending this weekend, so I booked separately a few days later. NBD....or it *wouldn't* have been a big deal, if I had booked at the correct hotel and not a different one down the road. 🤣 Now I get to figure out if I want keep my original reservation at the wrong hotel, where I can easily avoid my family, or cancel it and stay with everyone else. Decisions, decisions...\n\n\nEdit - Decided to stay at the (wrong) place I booked. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, or something 😅 It's my birthday and squaring up to be the worst birthday of my life. 27 and my life is going nowhere Is it just me or are the mosquitoes extra bad this year? Can’t go outside for longer than five minutes before being attacked even with repellent Are there any good antique stores in the area that sell watches?  I was up in New York a while back and there were all these cool stores with antique, reasonably priced, watches.  I figured there would be at least one store down here but I've found nothing so far.  I might visit the Marietta and/or Cobb Antique mall today, but I'm not sure vendors there sell watches. I've been reconsidering my idea to start a cult. I would really love to get a big group of like minded people together, have everyone give me their money and resources and set up nice haven for everyone to live happily and in an actual community. I hope this rainy - mild summer days continue till at least July 4th so I can run my first Peachtree without heat exhaustion  Having the weirdest Internet issues.

I do not have a car and want to go out for dinner to a place which is easily accessible via MARTA and I don't mind walking. I enjoy all types of Asian food (want to explore beyond the regular Japanese and Korean) and would love to check out Latin American or Caribbean food which is not crazy expensive since I'm a student. Any suggestions would be appreciated! [MARTA dining guide](https://roughdraftatlanta.com/marta-dining-atlanta-restaurants/) Almost anything in Decatur or take the bus up Buford Highway. Take the gold line up to the chamblee exit, there's tons of choices within a few feet to the right or left of the train exit several which are cuisines which you mentioned. Decatur station has a ton.\n\nEdgewood station would give you access to Bona Fide Deluxe and a short walk to others, and the Edgewood shopping center.\n\nInman Park station would give you access to all the restaurants in Inman Park, plus beltline access with a ton there, plus L5P if you dont mind walking/scooting. Kittydare The Decatur station is right in the middle of downtown Decatur, so there's a bunch of good spots within easy walking distance of there, bad restraunts don't survive, so hard to go wrong, but Chai Pani would be what i'd call out specifcally on a student budget.\n\nAlso the 39 bus that runs between Chamblee and Lindbergh station runs every 20 mintues, so anything along that corridor is also easily accessable. Some random places off the top of my head along that route are Lee's Bakery (vietnamese), Food Terminal (Maylay Chinese), Best BBQ (Cantonese bbq and noodle dishes), and Northen China Eatery.\n\nFrom North Ave Station the 2/102 buses  run frequently down Ponce, and they'll get you to Ponce City Market which has some good options inside, and puts you right on the beltline, which can be a nice way to kill an off day. \n\nKrog Street is along the beltline, and a bit of a hike along such either from Ponce City or from King Memorial (or Inman Park) stations, but it has IMO the best cheesteak in town at Freds Meat and Bread, plus Superica is a solid texmex place.\n\nI'm sure i'm missing some good places, but that's a start. following recommendations are all an \neasy walk from train station listed and very good restaurants!\nChamblee station:\nsouthbound, Antigo Lobo, blue top  \n\nDecatur Station :\nLeon’s full service , the brick store pub, Café Alasace, the Iberian pig, \nA little further from the station, but definitely worth the walk : the Kimball House, Chai Pani, \n\nBrookhaven station :\nTerra Terroir If you don't mind a bit of a walk (25-30 minutes) you can go to gsu or king memorial station and walk down to summerhill where there's a whole strip of restaurants. Five points, gsu, and Peachtree center are all downtown too and there are a ton of restaurants around there. Some restaurants on dekalb ave too (east point, inman park, and Edgewood stations). And ofc Decatur station is right in downtown Decatur and there are tons of options around there All of Downtown Decatur > I enjoy all types of Asian food (want to explore beyond the regular Japanese and Korean) and would love to check out Latin American or Caribbean food which is not crazy expensive since I'm a student.\n\nLike someone else said, take the bus up to Buford Highway.

Preferably different styles, including salsa, bachata, etc. Thanks in advance! hi - there are many places to go social Latin dancing! feel free to google them for timings/prices and all of them have instagram accounts that you can check. Though mostly these start at around 9:30-10pm and go on till 1-2am. Many of these places have a quick class at 9:30 before dancing starts.\n\nthere are usually 2 types of places you can choose to go to:\n\n* ones at clubs/restaurants where the vibe is more casual/beginner friendly and usually these are on a weekly/biweekly frequency \n   * 1st, 3rd and 5th Tuesday – BachaTuesday (Cafe Almenara) \n   * Every Wednesday – Tongue & Groove Latin Night \n   * Every Thursday - Eclipse Di Luna, Dunwoody (i believe the Buckhead one has it on a different day) \n   * Every Friday – Sanctuary Night Club \n   * Last Sunday of the month - Salsa Zero ATL (Very beginner friendly)\n\n\n* other category includes more serious dancing with quite many professional folks, these usually happen once a month (many of these are associated with dance classes) \n   * 1st Friday – La Mezcla Dance Social (Aatma Dance Studio in Chamblee) (this is where I have been learning since couple of years and its a great social to start with!) --Free Practice Hour also at Aatma Dance Studio every Wednesday at 9pm. Come and dance with the students after class. This is primarily focused towards our current and past students, but it is also open to the public. and you can bring some drinks & snacks to share! \n   * 1st Saturday – Ritmos del Barrio (Academy Ballroom in Buckhead) \n   * 2nd Saturday – Tumbao (Elements Dance Studio) \n   * 3rd Saturday – Mambo Mayhem (Atlanta Dance and Music Academy) \n   * 4th Saturday – PasoFino Dance Social (Academy Ballroom in Buckhead)\n\nHope you have a lot of fun dancing about!! The community is great and very welcoming! Not a club suggestion but if you join Aatma Dance Studio they often have like social gatherings/parties. They teach salsa and bachata. It's a great community they have a Whatsapp group and everyone just posts in there every so often about parties they'll throw. I love how thorough this response is! Thank you!",

Unfortunately, there aren't really any good options locally.  Barnes and Noble is probably the best which is just sad.  But at least they have a decent amount of Arrow/Criterion.  If you want to support a great small shop that offers shipping, check out [Orbit DVD](https://www.orbitdvd.com/) or visit them in Asheville. For new, I only know of Barnes and Noble. Unfortunately their selection isn't great (at least the one in Buckhead), and their pricing is terrible. They price everything at the MSRP that even the labels themselves never sell for. They usually have 50% of Criterion and Arrow sales, and that's really the only time it's worth it. \n\nThe best route is ordering from diabolikdvd.com or orbitdvd.com One of the biggest advantages of Blu-ray and dvd is the durability of the media. Why are you against buying used?  Great bargains, and it’s environmentally responsible. Walmart has new blurays. Some 4K and some new vinyl and new CD's. Try the mega Walmarts.. They also have complete TV seasons. \n\nAre you planning on collecting only brand new 4K? Because you should go the next step to steelbooks.\n\nSome media is OOP and you are going to have to settle for what is available. Have you tried 2nd & Charles? There's one in Kennesaw and Roswell. I have seen a fair share of brand new ones at thrift stores. Likely from stores that closed and donated them. But that’s the only place I’ve seen them Try 2nd & Charles! my walmart has them Suncoast, FYE, Sam Goody, Borders The mall",

I thought you were kidding, but…\n\n> The funding comes from the Neighborhood Access and Equity Program, a provision based on Williams’ Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants Act\n\nWas so excited about this one, every time I drive that section of the downtown connector I think about it. Hopefully we can figure out funding elsewhere. Literally. The stitch would be overly expensive and not even that nice. \n\nA nice solution that would be much cheaper is to close all car traffic and build a canal. \n\nChicago shouldn’t be the only city in America where you can ride a boat in a location where there are skyscrapers all around you\n\nA ferry would also be quicker than the current level of traffic on the connector too The connector really does split the city incredibly badly. I think the Stitch should be considered the first phase for other caps along the Connector, though the at-grade portions north of 10th and south of Freedom Parkway make it more problematic. To really fix the split, GDOT would have to de-freeway the Connector and turn it into a city street/boulevard.\n\nIn other words, that ain't happening.",

There are direct flights from ATL, only 4.5 hrs. \n\nTourism is down since COVID and the dollar both goes far there and their official currency. They’re coming out of their winter now (only 2 seasons winter/summer). Right on the Equator. We’re staying for around $40 per night in a nice modern apartment in a great area of town. Meals (like, nice ones) are $10-15 pp. all Ubers around the city are $4 or less. Fascinating history, excellent food, and lots of high altitude outdoor activities. Best and oldest chocolate in the world. \n\nCome on down! Around 7:30 or so last night, I was driving eastbound on I-20 and saw a rainbow that looked like it was coming out of a MARTA train. Then on southbound 75/85, it was raining on the northbound side only. Rainbow was still visible all the way home. Happy Pride?!

I'm about to see King Gizzard become mainstream. 3 nights of the best band on earth. And as I'm working media, holding out for the miracle I can interview them let alone just meet them. Giddy as a 33 year old dude. I hope everyone can find that magic that makes them giddy 6 AM on a Wednesday. Happy Roo! Anybody for recommendations for an orthopedic doc? I had one but it's getting worse and not happy with my care strategy. Particularly for lower back issues. Has anyone gotten their tax rebate yet? I'm still waiting.

Lowering speeds means nothing if they don’t increase enforcement or redesign streets to force people to slow down. They have 3 people out there dancing in traffic cone costumes. Sadly this will have little impact, even if enforced.  There are many studies that demonstrate that speed is a function of the road's design, location, etc.  I suspect this will cause more heartburn than not, but I recognize that at the very least it functions as acknowledgement of the problem. It's a good move but there's reasonable speed limits all over town. How about increasing enforcement? Honestly just make roads impossible to drive fast without hitting another car and you’ll solve so many issues with pedestrian and cyclist safety. 25 on Dresden is ridiculous. It's a cash grab that has nothing to do with safety What this means is they just increased their budget and need more revenue. As if it isn’t already a huge pain in the ass to get through Brookhaven Revenue not safety is the goal.",

    "chunk_text": "Low voltage interior electrician for specialty lighting recommendation needed I'm looking to hire someone to install LED motion sensor lights under each step in my staircase. They are called piano lights that light up sequentially with motion. I've had three electricians come by and they all recommend a low-voltage electrician that specialize in lighting. However I have been unable to find one online. Does anyone have any recommendations? Those electricians didn’t want to deal with the electronics and any finish work like stairs, not worth their time. \nIf they are bare wooden stairs I’d talk to a finish carpenter, most of the work will be the modification of the stairs anyway, they can even mount the lighting and you or an electrician can wire it up. out of 3 electricians that came to your house, all 3 were somehow unable to provide you any recommendations? Weird. \n\nhttps://verify.sos.ga.gov/verification/Search.aspx\n\nunder \"profession\" select Low Voltage and search. that will provide hundreds of pages of all certified LV contractors in the state. then filter by the area where you live. \n\nAlso btw here in GA, a Class 1 Electrical License authorizes any holder of the license (or any employee of the contractor holding the license) to repair or install any single phase system or device under 200 amps. So if the three electricians that came to your place were licensed, then all three of them are properly trained in LV and could legally install your stair lights. My guess is they all just did not want the job ...  If you wanted to do this and have it switchable/direct wired then it is going to cost a lot of money and be difficult to find someone to do it. I'm just some guy that does maintenance in a factory, so outside of there I'm not \"authorized\" to do this type of work. I could, but without looking I would estimate $4k + parts, and then around $150 to have a licensed electrician that normally does residential work to come out and do the final connections to your main electrical panel to finish the job \"legitimately.\" It may be possible to do it for way less, but it all depends on what wire access and mounting locations are available and how sleek you want it to be. Recess mounting would look great, but add a whole level of complexity. \n\n\nIf you really want it that badly then you could keep looking and find someone else that is more qualified, but I feel like they may end up charging you even more than that. It's just a ton of wiring, and more to the point of difficulty is that the wires have to be neat and out of sight. It's just a lot of work.\n\n\nAnother option here is to just get online and search for \"motion sensor color light\" and get something battery powered that mounts easily. Sure, you'll be changing or charging batteries every couple of weeks or months depending on what you get, but it'd just be a lot less complicated. Veaya from Mr Electric installed some outdoor lights for us recently and did a great job This is closer to the real answer, probably. Typically, this type of lighting is a strip that runs under the lip of each stair.  The problem is, stairs have a lot of building code requirements around them that an electrician isn't going to know about. Depending on the light, you might need to modify the stair to hide the light and wiring by creating a bit of a recess under the tread.  You probably want to do this by building up the edge of the tread, as routing a channel under the tread might cause structural issues.  The problem is increasing the depth of the tread, you might run up against some code but I can't think of one.  Either way, it's not something an electrician wants to guess about either.\n\nYou probably need a good carpenter that will then sub out the electrical.  While any electrician can do it legally, most aren't going to want to learn how to do it as it's not going to be a simple setup and they for sure don't want the warranty work.\n\nThere are home automation companies that [specialize in this type of lighting](https://atlantaaudio.com/solutions/smart-home-automation?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=automation&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmK_CBhCEARIsAMKwcD48I_-GNJvmOZKsvg43Up3Osu3FC0VOBMG9Q8E7WsCW1HU8BEDa-u0aAp4EEALw_wcB&utm_term=home%20lighting%20control%20system&utm_campaign=EMC+-+Rework+061121&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5466999301&hsa_cam=13476827221&hsa_grp=162594901616&hsa_ad=698998667697&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-307840027408&hsa_kw=home%20lighting%20control%20system&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21276291080) and could be a one-stop shop. I’m specifically asking about specialty interior lighting for low-voltage lights. The three electricians that came for estimates all do outdoor lighting, but cannot do low voltage interior lighting. That’s surprising. Most exterior yard lighting is low voltage. They probably just don’t want to work around a finished interior.",

It was definitely hot and the chicken was salty enough on the inside but it's like the seasoning on the outside was only cayenne? Ive tried Princes in Nashville and their seasoning was hot but also had other flavors going on instead of just cayenne flavor. Maybe I just went in on an off day but I'm open to any suggestions as I'm fiending for good hot chicken right now. \nP.S I know there's a few places with tenders but it doesn't hit the same as dark meat Try some of the Korean fried chicken places up in the NE burbs.\n\nMaybe Java Saga on BuHi has something similar too I like Gus’s - that was the spot that switched me to ordering thighs as the majority haha. \n\nIt’s not a traditional Nashville hot but it’s very tasty. \n\nScoville is tasty as well but I’ve only ordered the sandwiches there. Which temperature did you have at Hattie B's? The tender places suck. Hattie Bs is usually decent. But I've had it where there isn't enough of the chili-oil on the chicken. \n\nWe aren't spoiled with good hot chicken options here afaik. But there are several good Korean Fried chicken places that do great bone-in fried chicken.\n\nThat said, I too would love to know of a good Nashville hot place. \n\nMaybe Eugene's could expand over here from Bham... You will not find chicken comparable to Prince’s anywhere. Not even in Nashville. And if you do, please let me know!\n\nGus’s is delicious but an entirely different product.\n\nThe few times I’ve been to Hattie B’s the damn hot was pretty good. Shut the cluck up was always powdery and gross. Hop's Nashville hot chicken at Ponce City market does a really good spicy bone-in chicken. I got a thigh and a chicken sando, and was throughly impressed by each. Want to say it's better than Hattie B's but need to revisit to be sure.\n\nEdit: spelling Kinda not what you asked for but related, Argosy in EAV has a GREAT hot chicken sandwich. FWIW the hot catfish sandwich at fishmongers slaps. Highly recommended. Their homemade hot sauce is good and I usually hit it pretty hard with that as well. \n\nFamily Dog used to have hot chicken and waffles that were damn good.  They have a Nashville chicken sandwich, but I haven't  had it so it may not be the same recipe. Have you tried Pelicana on 14th?\n\n4.9 Stars of 4,979 ratings Gus’s World Famous Fried Chicken",

It works fine but if more than one person is talking, the online player can't understand what is going on. \n\nMy idea is to buy those cheap mini-mics that you see people use for videos outside / podcasts and have each of the players hook one to themselves. I see a lot of 2 mics + connector things on amazon and the price is pretty good looking to me. I am just concerned that we would have the same issue of two people talking at the same time and the online player can't understand anything though. \n\nObviously, I could just buy individual mics but that sounds too efficient and is probably more expensive. \n\nAnyone have thoughts?",

I thought you used to be able to do this at Wild Heaven but seeing that they serve food now. Thank you! You can kind of do this at Lee + White. Bring food, get beer from Wild Heaven or Monday Night, and sit in the public areas. Outrun in Stone Mountain. A good amount of breweries (particularly ones with large patio space and chill day to day) will be fine with you bringing your own food. Off the top of my head, I think both Monday Night locations, the outdoor garden for Halfway Crooks, both Scofflaw spots, Round Trip…honestly probably the outside West End space for wild Heaven and definitely their Decatur space, Three Taverns…I don’t see there being an issue from visits to these locations, from seeing customers doing it, and from employees being cool with it. Round Trip in West Midtown. The only possibility I can think of is Little Cottage, which is a metal bar and not for everyone. All the other breweries have food now. Not on the east side, but I imagine you could easily eat outside with your own food at Scofflaw at The Works.   \n   \nGuess maybe you could do the same outside of Imaginarium on the east side near the Eastern? Didnt think they had a full kitchen or anything. I have taken my own food to the original Monday Night when sitting outside and had no issues. They do have the pizza but no one mentioned anything to me. The quickest way to find out this info is to call and ask Wild Heaven in Toco Hills. It's technically also a Fox Bros location, but the outside with the benches is public space and you can bring whatever you want in there. Any truck and tap location (closest to me is Duluth)",

I upped my budget $5k or so and decided to go with a dealer certified used car for more peace of mind. The Mazda is 5 years newer and nearly 40k fewer miles (29k) than the CRV (68k) and has a way nicer interior. pls share your local-ish favorite coffee beans??? I’ve been using stumptown and like\nthem but nothing special. I tried rev beans and they were okay not bad not life changing. i don't always watch the Tonys but I'm glad i did this year because it was spectacular!  and seeing Maybe Happy Ending (which started at the Alliance) win Best Musical was the cherry on top. Did Covid kill the \"reasonably priced, exceptionally knowledgeable handyman\"?  2015-2020 it was so easy to find someone online, even on Facebook, that could come out the same week to fix a broken window, repair/replace an AC unit, fix some rotted out exterior trim.  Post 2020, in my experience, they either A) Aren't interested in a quick, simple project and will only come out if you want to do major renovations or B) Have no references, no show for an estimate, or arrive to your house in a rusted out 1990's Honda Civic reeking of alcohol.\n\nSure, its forced me to learn to do things on my own, which is great and all, but I have more projects than weekends available at this point. Is Calloway Gardens worth staying overnight? Trying to plan last minute Father's Day weekend for husband and will have a toddler and infant in tow. Reading mixed reviews about the lodge and food quality. He's not the golfing type so activities will be focused on trails and anything else they offer. Plan is to also check out Pine Mountain area and Roosevelt State Park. Worth staying at the resort or should we look outside?",

Do you know where? Buford Highway Farmers Market definitely has halal chicken.  I'm not sure if they specifically have halal chicken wings but you could call to ask.\n\nYour DeKalb Farmers Market probably does too, but I wouldn't swear to it.\n\nHonestly there are enough places that will have halal chicken that it would help to know where you are. This place is good if you’re near Decatur - https://albarakahhalalmeat.com.\n\nThey may not have chicken wings out in the display case, but you can ask for specific cuts to be butchered. There's a Halal place next to Patel Brothers in DeKalb. Nam Dae Mun has Halal Chicken if your on the northwest side of Atlanta. There are soooo many halal markets in the Atlanta metro area. You may want to see which ones are closest to you and call to make sure that they have what you want. Well it's not quite what you're asking for but rahim's chicken supreme in Lakewood uses all halal chicken and their wings are quite good and reasonably priced Delbar is halal. Talar's Market at 2495 Lawrenceville Hwy is halal. \n\n\nI don't know what they typically carry.  Halal Guys… There’s quite a few halal grocery stores on buford highway in doraville",

If this could be shared or upvoted to get more traction I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.  Hi\nBest thing to do would be call a school directly and ask to speak to the librarian and or the chair of the English department. And see if they can take the books. \nunfortunately, this is the wrong time of year to reach anyone easily at a school \n(Principals are there, but they have a lot going on and will likely be less helpful )\nSecond suggestion, how about calling the boys and girls club they might be able to take some books off your hands \nThird suggestion, little free library\nThank you for your generosity \nCheers My go to school is https://shelteringarmsforkids.com Thanks, I think that’s definitely the best way. If anyone knows any schools or teachers in particular that I could then reach out to that would be great.  start with your local high school.\nAs I said school is out for the summer and most teachers aren’t there, but the principal should be. \nIf your local high school is not interested or can’t facilitate a drop -off then call the boys and girls club of Atlanta. They have several teen rec centers and could probably use the books.",

I just get a simple cut so I’m not particular about which stylist I see, but they all have bios and links to their portfolios/instagrams if you want to peruse and pick a specific person Anyone at Melrose and McQueen is great! Ashley is amazing - www.prettyneatsalon.com technically L5P but that area. Aviary is a great salon- Ashley was there and I finally followed a stylist! [Chloe](https://www.instagram.com/_hairystylez?igsh=MTBveWtsNHZjZnQxOA==) or [Leigha](https://www.instagram.com/leighalane?igsh=cW9wejV4YW0yZXNm) at CLS Hair, not necessarily the area you’re looking in but 15 minutes drive to west midtown is worth it imo. Both are experts at blonde. I’ve been going to Chloe for over 6 years now Aviary Beauty, right near Krog st market!!! Amanda is amazing but sometimes because of scheduling I’ve had to choose other stylists and they’re all great. :) I've seen Ryan Lawless at Commoner Salon in Little 5 Points for years. He does great work, especially for really natural looking blonde highlights. Been going to native mane for years and I can’t recommend them enough! Love, love, love Leslie at Commoner! Chrystelle at Vivid in Morningside!!!! I would never see anyone else! My hair is also super healthy! Andrew at Van Michaels is amazing with color",

I have been going to Kelly's market in Decatur (which is amazing), But I live in O4W so I was hoping for a place closer to this area.  And I specifically mean, to take home - not consume on premises like a bar. Thanks! Soberish in Kirkwood Grant Park Market on Memorial by Oakland Cemetery has a great selection! Try Hop City!  Hop City and Total Wine both have a massive selection. \n\nThe Valero in downtown Kirkwood also has a surprising selection for a convenience store.\n\nEdit: should mention it’s the two Total Wines that DON’T sell liquor. The last time I was at Zero Co on North Highland, they had THC drinks for sale. I think I've seen them at Candler Park Market and Grant Park Market. Maybe not super close to you, but Total Wine has a whole aisle of them. This came up in a daily discussion recently and I had no idea how many options we had around Atlanta. Someone suggested Scofflaw brewing which is near me so I grabbed a four pack for a beach trip. They had 5 mg and 10 mg drinks, I got the 10 mg. They were great! Exactly the potency I wanted for a few days sitting at the beach. I found some at grant park market a few weeks ago. Nowadays and Cann Tower has an entire store in Doraville \n\nHigh Tower Wait-- THC drinks are legal in Georgia???",

The only specialized equipment you need is a kitchen torch.\n\nMy favorite that I have made is a play on banana pudding, infusing banana into the cream and making a vanilla wafer crumble onto the top. Poor Hendrix almost always had a rotating creme brulee (like maybe one a week a year they don't have). The flavor changes every week. The creme brulee is consistently good. Cool bottom, crunchy warm top. Great \"creme\" consistency, not like flan, not like pudding. \n\nNo offense to Kimball house but i always leave there broke, underwhelmed, AND HUNGRY. Kimball House Marlow's Tavern. Real vanilla bean specks. Le colonial Poor Hendrix is absolute perfection Crème Brûlée is my most favorite dessert. Rumi’s Kitchen used to have an Earl Grey crème brûlée that was divine. \n\nSt Germaine French Cafe & Bakery also has an excellent brûlée. Flemings was pretty good! Bistro Niko.

Are there any gay bars (or literally spaces) that are calm and genuine enough to have a conversation with someone?  Hmm I’m partial to Mary’s but it can get pretty loud there too. Much less cliquey though imo Answer- Oscar’s in Ansley square. Felixs is fine too right next door. If the mood strikes you, you can walk across the street to the eagle. Tripp's. \n\nFriends (during the afternoons). later at night it's great too but more like a rowdy dive bar.  Pour one out for Burkharts. RIP I’m not gay and neither are the owners of Red’s Beer Garden in Benteen Park but it is a very pro-LGBT place. Just about everyone who works there seems gay and they have lots of gay type events. That said it is a picnic table type place for groups and doesn’t seem single friendly if that is what you were looking for. I enjoyed the outside patio at X last time I was there but I have yet to find one. Woofs is probably the most calm although I’ve only been there for games. Most bars aren’t meant to have conversation with people, sadly. Eagle is good for a happy hour crowd if you are wanting a chill vibe and decent food. Also like Oscars and Felix’s. I’m also a big fan of the random nicer hotel bars. Always meet some interesting people and locals. Woofs as you mentioned is great for sure. BJ Roosters before the strippers go on (like 9pm) is cool and the lesbian bartender (Twee) is amazing. Lore is great! Mary's, but I go on Tuesdays, so YMMV My Sister’s Room is lit inside but they do have a huge patio out back that has a more chill vibe.",

What's considered affordable in terms of housing? Isn't sad the city finally finds something for a building vacant 52 years.  They are soooo slow at doing things. I hope this happens.

Good luck if you're buying it for yourself and don't care about the risk, but if you're feeding it to others, especially children, please do some research.\n\nThere's a reason why it's hard to find unpasteurized milk.

    "chunk_text": "Recommendations for laser hair removal near midtown Hey everyone,  \n  \nI’m looking to start laser hair removal and would love some recommendations for places in Midtown. I have medium skin (type 3-4), so I’m specifically looking for places that use YAG lasers since I’ve heard they’re safer for my skin tone.\n\nI’ve been looking at LaserAway, but there are a ton of other spots and smaller clinics online that also have good reviews. Just feeling kind of lost and would really appreciate any personal recs (smaller clinics or big chains), especially from folks with similar skin tones who had good results.\n\nI’m mainly looking to do underarms and full legs. If you’ve been somewhere and don’t mind sharing how it went or what you paid, that would be super helpful. I’ve seen some Groupon deals too but not sure how to tell what’s actually good vs just cheap.\n\nI’m planning to do a consultation before deciding, but would love to hear about any places you liked (or didn’t). Thanks in advance! I used Nyah Med Spa in Buckhead for years. They run GREAT specials all the time. Free parking. In and out in like 10 minutes usually. Have to book out in advance though they are high volume. I've been going to Milan in Buckhead for a while. I started with them when I lived in a different state and was able to seamlessly transfer to ATL when I moved. I've had incredible results on the underarms and am in the process of getting my lower leg done. I believe they use a combo Alexandrite/YAG laser. It's a flat fee per body part, but you get \"free\" touch ups for life. Also, as someone with HS, their staff are super knowledgeable about the condition and how to work around it. I have no idea what kind of laser they use, but I go to natural body spa in Morningside and am very pleased. They're running a special right now I’ve gone to many clinics and a few that I don’t even think are in business anymore in the past 10 years. The best has been Harlem Zen in Edgewood. It’s been a few years because of being pregnant/postpartum…but it was the best experience. I had the fastest and best results. They are very honest and have experience with darker skin tones. Also, I think their packages or memberships are pretty reasonable in price. I’m not sure what kind of laser was used on me but I paid $1500 for full legs and Brazilian.  They threw in underarms for free.  It included 6 treatments.  I don’t know what level my skin is but if we’re going by foundation shades, I’m fair which is above porcelain.  This was at a medspa outside of the city.  If you can swing the distance, I’d highly recommend looking OTP south to save some money.  Look in bougie areas of cities like Newnan or Covington. I went to Rosalind Michelle Skin Co by the Target on Caroline St for my underarms. I am type 5, and have been pleased with my results. The laser she uses is painless, can’t remember what it’s called but it’s cold vs hot. I did 6, maybe 7 sessions and I’m 95% hair free (was not expecting hairless, which was communicated to me prior). Each session was $175, but her packages are a pretty good deal. Ellemes Medical Spa in Sandy Springs! My friend got her laser done there by Jaycee and i’ve seen Lauren for years. They regularly win best med spa in Atlanta/Sandy Springs! Do you have a budget? \n\nI know it’s a bit out of the way but I go to a place near Cumberland called Skinsations. $1500 for full body (8 sessions).\n\nI’ve done 5 sessions and my results are pretty great so far! \n\nI have medium skin tone (south Asian) I've heard ideal image is great; I looked into them though and was shocked at the $3000 price tag for legs and Brazilian!!! Not sure if that's normal, I have a friend who got it done for $1k but that's my only reference point Oh that's great to know! Do you know if they work with medium/darker skin? I'll check them out though",

Tough time to be a sports bar in downtown/midtown The new Skol Brewpub in the basement of the Southern Exchange Building is really solid and a much better choice. Dang. It was a Dragon Con tradition of ours to go here after doing the blood drive on Thursday. Sad to see it go. Honestly, not a surprise since the service was abysmal when we went this past Dragon Con. Hope something nice goes in its place... but I'm not holding my breath because Downtown... Wonder how long until Hard Rock bounces.  Say what you want about tourist chains like that, but it's still not a great sign for downtown. 🎉🥳🎊 We need to support Max Lagers and White Oak. Two of the best places in Downtown. Back when I worked downtown, it was a great place to get a beer and watch soccer at lunch during the 2022 World Cup, praying the partners didn’t come in and see us drinking beer during lunch. Went once before a Hawks game, guess I should’ve went more if I wanted it to remain open. But in its current stage, Hooters was more for beer and sports “and views,” the food pretty much sucked.\n\nThat leaves really only Hudson Grill and Park Bar as sports bars downtown. And STATS and I guess Wild Leap can count too. Save us Centennial Yards! Well... Now where will I watch Atlanta United at DragonCon?",

My SO has been depressed so I've spent the past year doing all the chores and trying to tough out a rough time in our marriage and deal with the lack of emotional support from them. It finally got to me on May 13 and I broke down to the point that my therapist recommended an in-patient facility for me. \n\n\nMy SO filed for divorce the very next day. Wasn't even gonna tell me. Wrote a note they planned to leave and just ghost me. They couldn't support me for one day in the same way I'd supported them the past year. They've been asking for money frequently over the past year and I didn't worry about it, thinking if we ever did split up that it would be reallocated to me. Wrong. It's seen as gifts to the court. $25K of my money is just theirs now, despite them making more. \n\n\nEveryone says marriage can be tough, and I was trying to be a good partner, thinking that I had their back and they had mine. Turns out this was just a transaction to them. I'm gutted.  Last week I applied for a job, and heard back the next day asking for my portfolio, and then they requested an interview! This moved so quickly normally I'd think it was a scam, but it's actually legit.  \n  \nI had a great interview yesterday and I think this would be a good fit for both parties, so please send lots of good vibes/prayers/positive war chants in my direction. 😆\n\nAlso I've been funemployed since January and could really use a breakthrough haha 🥲 is it just me, or are there more potholes than ever in this god forsaken city Hey everyone, will be in Atlanta for three weeks or so during the Club World Cup. Just saying hello and may have a question from time to time.\n\nWill be staying near Civic Centre MARTA stop, which I know is not ideal location but seems ok for some transport (won’t have a car). Which is better out of Lyft or Uber, or are they about the same? Hope everyone is celebrating National Donut Day today and getting one (or five) from your favorite local donut shop! I was pulling my bicycle in earlier this week when I heard a loud bang on Chappell.\n\nAround the corner a couple of people are on the ground but one looks way worse, so I assume he was the one on the dirt bike. The thing is thrashed, it looked like he was bleeding, and no helmet anywhere, which isn't surprising. Some bystanders were rolling him over on his side but I never saw him move once before EMS appeared so couldn't even tell if he was conscious or alive.\n\nFrom what I can tell he collided with someone pulling out their driveway because the other guy is laid out but his family was nearby and seemed unharmed. But he's got like toddlers who are freaking out.\n\nJust dumb dumb dumb dumb. Pointless. Won't change my opinion of our current Governor, but $500 randomly showing up in my checking account was sure a nice surprise.  I had no idea the State was sending out additional refunds. This week's been rough. But my sweet little hound dog is feeling a little better. \n\nShe got her first heartworms shot last week, and has been drugged since. So she's been a bit out of it for the past week. 🫣\n\nLast night she cuddled on the bed for the first time in a while. Such a sweet girl. Has anyone done the math on switching to the peak/off peak rates with GA Power? I calculated what we would have paid over the last year based on our hourly usage, and we would have saved over $800!!",

I’m looking for a physical therapist who can help me both with pain management as well as better posture and appearance, who takes insurance. Thanks!!  Team Rehab takes my BCBS I went to druid hills PT after my latest injury. They accept insurance and do 1 on 1 therapy. Normally my doctor walked between a few patients, but here you get all the attention. went to emory PT for a while (right by the new children’s hospital) with a really nice lady who was specialized in scoliosis. did dry needling / strength exercises, took my insurance and the copay wasn’t crazy, overall it was really helpful. wish I could still go but can’t with my job hours :’)  Many of them will take your insurance. I had a good experience at Druid Hills PT. I just called them and asked them to run it through my insurance and see how much it would cost me, which they did and then I ended up going.  \n\nDo you have any sort of referral from a doctor? I believe you can get insurance to cover PT for certain things for a certain amount of time without a doctor referral, but sooner or later you’re going to need a referral. Possibly even before you go.   Look for somebody who is trained in the Schroth method Another recommendation for Druid Hills PT or their new site, Avondale PT.  I don’t think they take Cigna but they do take BCBS.  I’ve been to both locations and have been very happy with their one on one care. What part of town is convenient for you ? I assume you’ve had a full workup from an orthopedic specialist, surgeon or neurosurgeon? One of those providers would refer you to PT and pain management as needed.\n\nAny PT place is going to need a referral and also needs to know what is going on in your back, otherwise they could do significant harm.",

These two seem to have a lot more Vietnamese and Southeast Asian products than some of the other farmers markets. I'm not sure if there's a difference in brines but middle eastern grocery stores might have pickled lemons. Theirs will just be salt and lemon juice to make the pickles. You can try Trinh Grocery Store on Lake Harbin in Morrow.  Morrow has a large Vietnamese population.  There’s also a Nam Dae Mun in Morrow as well. Try Jusgo near Costco Duluth. Vietnamese grocery. Also has really good produce. How are these eaten? Do you actually just eat it as is or is it used as in cooking?",

It’s called Ninja Puppet Shenaniganza and looks like it’s going to be fun Everyone be safe out there and hug your loved ones extra hard today, the world is such a scary place. Morning all! Tracking the Wal Mart delivery truck that has my Switch 2 (that is allegedly two stops away) and hopefully having a day full of Mario Kart.\n\nEdit: it's here! Plus they threw in a free Coke and a can of Pringles lol. Rain rain go away… Wow. Walmart delivered my Switch 2 at 6:50am. Who has the best biscuts and gravy in the metro?

    "chunk_text": "PT rec for herniated disc I have severe pain from a herniated disc from lifting weights - I have a great doc at Peachtree Ortho but wasn’t impressed with their PTs. I’m looking for some better PT options. \n\nI know PT’s don’t typically specialize in one area of the body, but if anyone knows someone who has been particularly great for herniated discs (and helping return to weightlifting), I would really appreciate it! I prefer somewhere that takes insurance if possible, although I’m aware that sometimes people recommend avoiding some of those places (like BenchMark.) If someone is cash based but truly remarkable then I am open to seeing them. \n\nWould prefer proximity to Sandy Springs / Buckhead (open to Dunwoody, Marietta, Brookhaven, Midtown, West Pace/Vinings as well). \n\nThank you SO much!  Decatur Hand and PT. Absolute miracle workers. Rob was incredible. I don’t have a PT recommendation but I have a herniated disc in my lower back and my ortho doctor recommended Pilates to help stabilize my core. It honestly works wonders for my back pain. It still flares up occasionally but it’s not as bad now. I am able to lift weights safely as well, though I work with a trainer to make sure my form is good and I’m not going to injure myself further I encourage you to discuss this with your doctor.  I have worked with most of the spine specialists at Peachtree Ortho over the years, and this is something they would want to know (even if you do find a better PT provider). Love Druid Hills PT. Motion Stability in Buckhead. They have EXPERTS on staff who don't take insurance, and geniuses who do. They have helped me TWICE!\n\nYou'll be back to weightlifting soon I bet. Good luck Woah. Very similar experience. The PT there was very hands off after the 2nd visit. Like I might as well just go to a gym. Hopefully someone else has good recommendations. Check out Matt Underwood in Chamblee; he is very knowledgeable and helpful. He helped diagnose my collapsed disc, recommened surgeons, and when I turned down the surgery option, worked with me to strengthen the muscles in my back. Highly recommend! Just finished a course of PT at OrthoAtlanta in Brookhaven and was very impressed.  I know it’s further out but SportsCare in John’s creek is great. Can get busy though Check out movement medicine PT. Cash based and should be one on one.",

Luckily we were able to repair the shower but will need to fix the damage on the ceiling now.... You can see where the water pooled and caused the drywall to peel away.\nAny recommendations or anyone willing to quote would be much appreciated! You're probably best off going with a general handyman for a small job like that. It's tough to get a real drywall outfit to come in and do patch work. They want to come in and do a whole room, a whole floor. And I assume you've corrected the water issues that lead to the damage? You should probably make sure there's no mold there  first. I got you.\n\nhttps://patchmaster.com/central-atlanta/ Had Jamey do work for us twice, he does quality work and good prices, loves pets. \n\nhttps://nextdoor.com/pages/jdc-drywall-acoustical-ceiling-inc-marietta-ga?init_source=business_page_detail&share_platform=10&utm_campaign=1749086179553&share_action_id=a03d18d8-2ba7-401c-84f6-99c7332a3099 Might as well cut open the drywall (cloth underneath) to make sure mold isn’t growing, and also to definitely let moisture escape. Company called “at your service” did work for me. I had a leak and they came and didn’t mold remediation, patched and painted. You can’t even tell I had work done. ok that’s good to know, with the size of the stained area it initially looked kind of severe with the separation where that large bubble was formed so i assumed this would not be considered easy. We did fix the leak so it is only the repair of the ceiling drywall thank you, yes we have corrected the water issue so it’s purely the ceiling repair. I guess i assumed this wouldn’t be considered a small job with the size of the affected area but i know absolutely nothing about drywall repair > We did fix the leak so it is only the repair of the ceiling drywall\n\nCurious what you did for that",

Should only be another hour even though no one else is here\".\nTaco Mac used to be my spot from like 2002-2020, and I just had to stop going Taco Mac in Midtown had the worst service and food I've ever had.  Nothing of value was lost. Taco Mac has sucked for like 10 years now. They killed a great thing. Taco Mac is great. A huge selection of beers they are always out of, and the coldest hot wings in the south. If none of that sounds great to you, that's fine. You'll have plenty of time to just chill and watch TV since your server will never visit you. But don't worry, it probably won't be something you'd actually want to watch. Despite all the Atlanta United stuff on their wall, they will argue with you that they don't show the games. This is not good for midtown. I know this location had poor service but this just adds another large space that will likely sit vacant for at least a year. I remember when this one opened. It was the flagship Taco Mac. They poured all their resources into that place. How the mighty have fallen. If anyone has eaten there in the last 10 years they understand why. Private equity killed a great restaurant brand.\n\nIn my early 20s I was a regular. My name's on a plaque in the Midtown location. I stocked my kitchen with glasses exclusively from their Thursday glass giveaways. Watched untold numbers of Georgia Tech and Braves games. Made friends with servers (that I am still friends with today!).\n\nSad to see how bad it got. Just don't mess up the Vortex! They should study the downfall of this place..They used to have the best beers on tap and the best wings/burgers in town. It was my Wife/I go to for over a decade. \n\nNow it's ALL little leagues every time I visit. The kids meals are cheap and it's a \"sports bar\" for the parents. The food is TERRIBLE these days and the only decent service is at the bar.. And a 3rd location (downtown Decatur) was closed a bit over a year ago.  \n\nTaco Mac sure seems like a sinking ship.",

There was just a post on here about renting a Cricut machine via the library, makes me think possibly some libraries have projectors available to check out?!

Got delayed a third time and they finally said it was having battery/electrical issues. That stuff can be a pain to ever get sorted, so I don’t want to roll the dice on that. At least they were fast with the refund and the money is already back in my bank account.\n\nGoing to give up on Carvana and just buy something local. Going to spend a bit more and get something a bit newer and dealer certified pre-owned I think. I keep my cars a long time (will be moving on from a 2008 Mazda 3) so I’d rather have more peace of mind on reliability/longevity and having some dealer warranty on powertrain etc. Leaning toward a Mazda CX-5 after more research. Like the design of them better than CRV and the 2022-23 models have some good options used and reviewed better than CRV and RAV 4 those years. Going to check some out and maybe buy if I like one Friday. Is there a place where I can try out and purchase used cameras? I've always wanted to start photography as a hobby and I thought it would be best to actually try cameras out instead of blindly ordering a used one online. Somewhere around Sandy Springs/Dunwoody would be best but I'm willing to drive out further! After putting it off for years, I finally got some vegan Italian “beef” (seitan) from Buona in Chicago just as I think they are discontinuing the at home version they put out. It is…not that great so I get it. But any excuse to eat a boatload of giardiniera is good enough for me Anyone know any good watch stores in Atlanta (can be OTP)?  Looking in the $1000-$1500 at the top end of the range, but maybe trying to see if I can find something in the $750-$1000.  So far, surprisingly, Macy's in Lenox Mall had a good selection of Hamilton, Longines, and Rado watches.  The other stores, like Nordstrom, only carried Tissot and Seiko watches.  Don't mind those brands, but *every* store has them.  All the other stores in Lenox are brand specific, and I'm not in a position to buy a Grand Seiko, Tudor, or similarly priced watch.\n\nI hate the idea of spending $1500 online for something I can't try on.  Farer watches look really cool but they don't sell them locally.  There are a lot of cool microbrands out there but the problem is you can only see them online. Metallica puts on a great show. Was my first concert at the Benz. Very excited about INK two-day run at Tabernacle. Silver Scream 1 and 2 are cool concept albums. Probably the right call. Electrical gremlins aren't something I'd want to take a chance on. I’ve heard really god things about the CX-5! I have an 08 Civic and I’ve been browsing for a 2022 Honda Accord Sport My fiancé and I have a 2019 Mazda cx-5 and love it! I feel pretty safe driving in the city with it. As someone who knew 2 people with CX-5s **sit in one first**.\n\nThe seats can be either great or incredibly uncomfortable depending on your frame, so you really should try it out first.\n\nOther than that they're *great* cars, so hopefully you like the fit lol.\n\nAlso if you care about touchscreen carplay/android auto, only the 2024 model+ is touchscreen in carplay/AA, otherwise it's rotary knob only (all models are still rotary knob only in the mazda infotainment) Can't try them there but I've always heard good things about [KEH Cameras](https://www.keh.com/) in Smyrna for purchasing used cameras and equipment.",

Are there any bar/breweries/restaurants, etc. where that might be allowed? Not sure if breaking out a poker set and gambling would be allowed in public, just curious if there are any places where we could do this  if you're wanting to actually have a private poker game where you play for cash with your friends, you're not going to find a bar to host that.\n\nif you are just wanting to play some poker for the fun of it, there's definitely some spots that host poker leagues you can go to and play. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/freerollatlanta Many bars hold their own poker nights but hosting your own you would need to ask a specific place. \n\nAnd don’t mention you’re actually gambling or there’s a 0% chance any of them let you do that, that’s not legal and they have nothing to gain from it lol. Just say you’re playing for “fun” and I’m sure some breweries wouldn’t care as long as you’re drinking there. Give me $300 and you can do it at my place Chamblee Tap & market does free games on Thursdays IIRC Playing at a brewery that normally hosts board games should be totally normal.\n\nWent to Mutation Brewing in Sandy Springs for my birthday the other day and they actually have a poker chip set as one of their \"board games\". Gino’s on Cheshire It's not legal, so most pubs will say no. Atlanta Poker Club skirts the law by offering games with no entry fees and non-cash prizes. Lots of bars have poker nights, I think Battle and Brew started one as well but haven't checked in on it Maybe battle and brew will let you do that Fun fact - playing poker for money is actually illegal in Georgia. It’s some of the strictest gambling laws in the country\n\nThat’s going to make it really really hard to find somewhere to play. You may be able to find a smaller more local place that lets you play if you say you’re just playing for fun and not betting for money. \n\nIf I were you I’d look into places that would let you book a private room for “game night”. Especially if you do it not at peak times you can likely get a private room for cheap. Some places may even do it for free as long as you are ordering food and drinks and it’s not a busy time",

Nice Can someone explain if this is a good move? It seems like they will be away from all the CBS programming that would feed into their broadcast. I know nothing about this industry so just wanted to see why this is happening. Interesting to have a second O&O in town. WAGA is owned by Fox. I remember when it was a UPN affiliate and broadcast Star Trek Voyager. In 1996, during one episode, they had a call-in contest for callers 6 and 9 for tickets to a Star Trek convention in Huntsville. Two tickets to the convention. Travel and hotel were on you. I was staying with a friend, called the number and the person who answered asked for my number and told me she'd call me back as I was caller 6. I told my friend, he said, \"No, you're lying.\" Told him, fine, you're not going with me. Five minutes later I got the call back to get all my information to get my tickets. Another friend wanted to see the astronauts that were also there, so he took care of travel and the hotel. I still have a hockey jersey souvenir from the convention.\n\n[https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/vintage\\_alcom\\_rocket\\_city\\_rena.html](https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/vintage_alcom_rocket_city_rena.html) This must've been coming for a while given how little channel 46 acknowledges being a CBS affiliate in its branding\n\nAlso, the other thing floating in the room here is that the private equity group that owns Cox Media Group (the Cox family sold a majority stake years ago) which owns channel 2 has put CMG up for sale and Gray will almost certainly be a bidder on at least some of the stations if not the whole thing\n\nWould not be surprised if Gray ends up owning Channel 2 Nice. Nice.  If I were them, I would move The CW over from PeachtreeTV to ANF. That way they could have two hours of primetime programming on the regular instead of relying on whatever they’re gonna rely on. Maybe news during primetime? How much news can they get? My curiosity is: will WUPA 69 & CBS atlanta still be located in their broadcast offices right on I-85 near the Shallowford exit? It’s an extremely small space and probably not well kept, and shares with a ton of random different tenants. Are they gonna broadcast from there considering the start date is soon, lease another station, or build a new one of their own? Super interested in finding the answer",

All they have done with the money is grab land, such as Turner Field, and buildings in the area to continue to expand. Meanwhile, the insides of their campus buildings are hot garbage. Tear them all down. Just an eyesore You know, it's kinda funny... I've been thinking about how we could maybe urbanize some of our core substations as the city densifies... and then here is a classic example of what used to be exactly such a site, about to be torn down.\n\nNot that I think it should be a substation again (it's too small), but there is a certain flavor of irony all the same.\n\nOverall, I think GSU has plenty of pre-existing parking lots they could use if they really, really want a greek-life 'open space'. Lords know there are plenty of other lots and empty properties along Edgewood otherwise... It would be nice to keep the building, and maybe even incorporate it into a wider housing push by the school and county and city to fill in the parking lots around the Auburn Research Library with proper development. That would require thinking outside the box. It in fact has many large interior load bearing pillars which would make it difficult to accommodate adaptive reuse. The exterior is quite attractive with the nice brickwork but that's because it was essentially industrial infrastructure trying to blend into a commercial space... It is weird how much GSU wants to tear out a building given how much surface parking it already has available for infill...",

I’ve also had one experience with a MF couple. She (34F) gets extremely turned on by it and loves hearing about it, seeing pics/vids and chatting with guys while we fool around. Lately she’s been much more open to joining and we’re actively looking to make that happen. Shes still very new to the idea of joining directly, so we may take things a bit slow at first. \n\nHer top fantasies are playing with a woman and sharing a cock with me orally. I’m a bottom, and I prefer being with a guy who is more dominant. I’m not into humiliation but I love it when a guy takes the lead, tells me what he likes and teaches me to worship and pleasure him, and I’d also like to see him with her. I like bears/daddies, and BWC. I love cum. \n\nIn Buckhead. \n Make sure your post complies with rule number 1. Members who post Spam, Self Promotions, or Single Men Posts Will Be Permanently Banned.
