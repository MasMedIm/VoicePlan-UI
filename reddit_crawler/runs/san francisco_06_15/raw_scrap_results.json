I wanted to. I support everything it stood for. What Trump is doing right now feels scary. The military parade, the ICE raids, troops being sent into cities like LA. I hate all of it. I was proud to see so many people marching here in San Francisco. People were on Market, Civic Center, the Mission. Holding signs, chanting, showing up.\n\nBut I didn‚Äôt go because I didn‚Äôt want to show up alone. I don‚Äôt have anyone to go with. \n\nI also didn‚Äôt feel totally safe going there solo. I‚Äôve been reading about cops making arbitrary arrests at protests, or firing into crowds with less-lethals, or people driving cars into marches. Even theft happening in big groups. I know SF is usually better about that kind of thing, but I still didn‚Äôt feel safe being alone in the middle of it all. \n\nAccording to [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-vehicles-struck-injuries), \"In San Francisco, at least four ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù protesters in San Francisco were struck by a motorist who then fled the scene, according to NBC News. Law enforcement detained the individual, and stated that the protesters suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\"\n\nI moved to SF a year ago. I haven‚Äôt made any friends here. I‚Äôm a mid 20s Indian-American guy, I work in tech as a software engineer. I‚Äôm probably on the high functioning autism spectrum. I haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed, but it tracks. Social stuff has never come naturally to me. I‚Äôve tried all the obvious stuff. Meetup.com, bars, running clubs, salsa classes, volunteering. People talk to me once, maybe twice, and then they stop. I know I‚Äôm awkward. I just don‚Äôt know how to not be.\n\nI care deeply about progressive political causes: trans rights, immigrant rights, abortion access, democracy, anti-racism, and economic justice. Even in a city where these liberal values are widely shared, I still struggle to form friendships. \n\nBack when I lived in a red city, being liberal naturally brought people together because we were a minority supporting each other. Here, where those values are the default, they don‚Äôt spark the same sense of camaraderie.\n\nI feel like I missed something today. Not just the protest. I mean the feeling of being part of something. Instead I just walked around and watched from a distance. Then I went home.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting posting this. Maybe nothing. I just wanted to say it somewhere.\n\nIf anyone else feels like this, you‚Äôre not the only one. New to our subreddit?

(Turns out that closing a school site is harder than closing a military base https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_Realignment_and_Closure#Law ) Anyway, that takes care of that and the state might very well end its oversight by the end of the year. \n\nAlso:\n\nhttps://www.sfexaminer.com/news/education/sfusd-avoids-teacher-layoffs-in-balanced-budget-release/article_e1486e0f-bd0a-43b3-a231-8fa1f537c5c3.html\n\nhttps://abc7news.com/post/san-francisco-unified-school-district-superintendent-maria-su-gives-insight-what-expect-2025-26-year/16726366/\n\nFTA:\n\nAfter years of financial crisis, the San Francisco Unified School District has balanced its budget and is on the path to solvency, it announced Friday.\n\nSuperintendent Maria Su has made $113 million in cuts, largely through staffing reductions. She will present the 2025-26 school year‚Äôs budget to the Board of Education on Tuesday. If approved the following week, it will be submitted to the state for approval.\n\n‚ÄúI have been laser-focused on our budget,‚Äù Su told reporters Thursday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had to make a lot of really tough decisions.‚Äù >¬†Those cuts include layoffs mostly to administrators at The City‚Äôs central office and other ‚Äúnon-classroom positions‚Äù\n\n>¬†The district announced in April that while no teachers would lose their job under the now-submitted budget, the district was eliminating 205 jobs from its central office. That resulted in laying off around 100 workers.\n\nHow many administrators are employed at the central office and what do they all do? Apart from the lottery when our kid was placed, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever interacted with a central office administrator¬† It says a LOT when these cuts are finalized and announced 2 weeks after school ends, when most families are checked out/on holiday/not able to really connect as a community in person with PTO/staff.¬†\n\n\nNo details, no idea what this means for the school sites.... that is a hefty amount of cuts.¬†\n\n\nI guess we'll only find out in..... August when schools starts, and THEN PTO and families can scramble go make up the shortfall.¬†¬†\n\n\n(Namely- college and career counselors at the larger high schools have been gutted, families urgently hiring private consultants for college navigation...) Or rather, the school cut staff and teachers rather than make the necessary confrontations with special interests. ‚ÄúMy school is important to meeeeee!!!‚Äù types.\n\nEveryone suffers so a few can be indulged. There have been community meetings for months. If you don't know, you haven't been paying attention",

The #1 security advice you need is to keep aware of the situation and leave when you no longer feel comfortable, e.g. if agitators within the protest try to cause escalation or if cops start acting up. \n\nOtherwise, the risks & preparation needed are probably not so different from participating in Bay to Breakers or Pride. Photographers are important, but please be responsible - avoid posting or publishing photos that could be used to identify protestors. Blur faces and things like tattoos. (If someone gives you explicit consent that‚Äôs obviously different)\n\n***edit: ultimately people will do whatever they want. I am providing a prospective that anyone supporting these protests should consider. Many have pointed out how the administration can and does use identification technology to find people that attend protests and this is one way to combat that while still documenting this important moment in history.

Imagine stealing what amounts to many person's ONLY means of transportation - to get to work; to shop; to transport kids to school, etc. General advice is to use at least 2locks on bikes, 3 if expensive or sketchy area, 4 if both.\n\nDon't listen to your friend, let them go inside next time, get you ice cream while you wait next time.\n\nWon't guarantee your bike wont be stolen but significantly likely they will target easier bikes to steal. wow. the audacity. if you had seen him, would you confront him? Go over to mission st lol sure they‚Äôre selling it somewhere. Also add an AirTag somewhere they can‚Äôt see it. Yeah it‚Äôll notify them but hopefully you mount/hide it well enough to find it before they do.",

Hi everyone!\n\nI‚Äôm thinking of starting a horror-themed club hosted at a local coworking space in the Cow Hollow/Marina area. It would be a casual, open group for people who love talking about all things creepy: horror movies, games, urban legends, true crime, or just your own morbid curiosities!\n\nMy hope is to create a space where we can embrace the eerie, unsettling, and weird, without judgment. Basically, a chill hangout for people who find comfort in the uncomfortable.\n\nIf that sounds like something you (or someone you know) would be into, let me know! Just trying to gauge if there‚Äôs any real interest before planning the first meetup.\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for the interest! I'm going to work on getting this up and running! ![gif](giphy|SooyOjmoipDD7Fnk45|downsized) Definitely interested! This is a cool idea! This is definitely a build it and they will come type thing. I think you‚Äôll find there‚Äôs no shortage of people into horror, macabre and mystery in this city and SF needs more community building spaces as it can often feel hard to break into spaces if you haven‚Äôt found your people. \n\nBest advice is to really have a vision for what it will look like and how it can grow and engage. Then once it starts doing so, allow the club to shape itself! Just upvoting and commenting to counteract whoever downvoted this. This isn't my interest, but the city could use more people taking initiative to start social gatherings.",

Mostly borrowed from the books *How to Blow Up a Pipeline* and *On Tyranny*. **Please try to consider these from a viewpoint of nuance instead of good/bad binary judgment...**\n\n\\* This protest is meant to **push back** against a punitive, constitution-flouting administration and show that the public won't abide abuse of power, PLUS ideally it will **recruit more people** to the cause to gain more momentum. That means...\n\n\\* The burden is on protesters to be very careful and selective with their actions. It is **EXTRA** **responsibility** that the opposition does not have and it is not fair. But it's important to act in a way that will hopefully **recruit more people** to the cause and lead to a snowball effect. And don't alienate the people you're fighting for or besides by mistake, such as immigrants, working class people etc! That said you are definitely there to ruffle some feathers, just make sure they are the right feathers\n\n\\* At a big march, there will be a lot of people participating for different reasons, some you'd probably disagree with or not want to associate with. **Avoid the temptation to in-fight** and remember the bigger fish to fry, and that we need a lot of people joined together to succeed\n\n\\* Lastly, (the most nuanced point to try to keep in mind), a protest is most effective when there's a bit of an unhinged element to remind the opposition that they should **bargain with the level-headed, peaceful demographic** to stave off the less predictable chaos that comes from the fringe. This is discussed in depth in *How to Blow Up a Pipeline*, e.g. the LBJ administration strongly preferred to deal with peace-first advocate MLK *because* it meant they could sideline the much scarier Malcolm X.

We could go to some old haunts that are still open. I checked comedy shows and nobody performing we want to see. The Giants aren't playing in SF. Are there any cool things to do in August that are fun like rock, comedy, underground sub-culture, festivals etc? I live here and find it annoying I can't find much in August.  SF festival season is in August. The city is now having an additional two festivals in August in Golden Gate Park.: Outside lands, 60th anniversary of Grateful Dead 3 day festival, and then one day show with Zach Bryan/ Kings of Leon check out stern grove, concerts outside of sf, festivals etc. also street fairs, etc.\n\nmay want to look at event calendars for more ideas As stated below, you can find a lot of large festivals like OL and Grateful Dead and Kings of Leon in August. For others, you can look at places like The Masonic across from Grace Cathedral, Cafe Du Nord on Market, and The Chapel on Valencia for things booked into August. For comedy, I would recommend Cobb‚Äôs Comedy Club on Columbus and Cheaper Than Therapy on Sutter.\n\nA lot of the more ‚Äúunderground‚Äù events you‚Äôll find in SF aren‚Äôt scheduled that far in advance since it‚Äôs still mid-June and they‚Äôre currently marketing for big events like Pride and the 4th.\n\nFor all events, I would recommend checking out places closer to the month? ra.com for more club-based things, they post a lot of techno and dj sets for a ton of venues in SF. If you‚Äôre interested in rock, Kilowatt bar has a good array of sets. In terms of jazz, etcetera wine bar has jazz nights on saturday.

    "chunk_text": "The uncomfortable truth people don't want to hear There will never be widespread ebike/emoped adoption in SF due to the prevalence of bike theft and no action on follow up for punishments or getting your shit back. \n\nThis was just coming to me as a shower thought more than anything and I'm just saying shit out my ass as a disclaimer but here goes \n\nI've just noticed that really this sub is so probike and anticar and thats really one of the most divisive issues in SF politics when it comes down it some of these things like the great highway or market street or whatever; people WANT bikeable walkable cities but that kind of lifestyle isn't accessible to everyone. \n\nMy first point is that ebikes and emopeds is the future of transportation in big cities and it's something that I saw in China where ebikes and emopeds are absolutely EVERYWHERE. It's just the future of transportation because of how simple and easy it is. The city is small enough so that ebikes and emopeds should be viable for anything you need to get to and parking spaces are such a bitch to find now I want an ebike or a emoped to get around. It'll save me gas money and it's honestly kind of fun to ride around in a bike and grab some food and enjoy the air. \n\nThat brings me to my second point. I can't get an ebike or an emoped unless the places I go will have safe and secure parking and I know that my shit is not getting stolen. I'm sure people have had the anxiety that their shit isn't gonna be there when they parked and are gone for a few hours. The main problem is that we don't punish bike theft or follow through on getting shit back. A couple years ago, dude it was on this sub, we ALL saw how many bikes these homeless encampments had and how prevalent bike theft had become. Look I remember in 2014 - 2015 when I actually biked to work and biked to safeway and people left their bikes out on bike racks and it was actually difficult to find a space to park your bike. Now you'll often find that bike racks are bare cuz no one trusts leaving their bike out places. My building has a bike garage but it had been broken into so many times no one really trusts leaving their bike in it. Really.... ebikes and emopeds have become a sort of inaccessibility that only a few people who have space in their houses can afford. \n\nMy third thing is that the great highway, market street, Jfk drive... all these places are great places for people to ebike/emoped to and enjoy the car free space. Would be nice. But yo. People don't have ebikes and emopeds to enjoy it lmfao. They can only access it with their cars. So it creates an unequal access where people get riled up. \n\nSo until the issue of bike theft is addressed and people start facing the music for that shit and people can expect to have safety in storing their bikes out in public. All these things about the great highway or market street or jfk drive will continue cuz it's not something many people can access. Emoped/ebike mobility development also is going to be stunted in the city when it has so much potential to decrease traffic jams and make transportation more efficient New to our subreddit?

Thank you.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/sanfrancisco) if you have any questions or concerns.* I have a $3500 e bike that I have put 7000 miles on since 2017 exclusively riding around SF.  I lock it on the street several times a week and it has never been stolen.  You can insure it for $200/year I thought this way when I first moved here, but now as someone who primarily bike commutes, I don‚Äôt think this is as much of an issue as people think. Just get a high quality lock and chain to loop through the back tire, park the bike somewhere with plenty of foot traffic and ideally in view of the window, and don‚Äôt leave it out overnight. There are areas where this method may fail (parts of SoMa, TL, parts of mission), but in a majority of the city it‚Äôs effective during daylight era. \n\nThis will always be a chicken and the egg problem, because you need people to bike to get pressure for better policy, but need better policy to get people to bike. The savings of not dealing with a lot of car-related fees also pretty quickly offset any bike issues even if you don‚Äôt insure a bike and it‚Äôs stolen, and cars also come with property crime risk here. It‚Äôs not the ideal situation, and it‚Äôs reasonable to prefer to drive, but it‚Äôs not the insurmountable and financially reckless alternative to driving this post makes it out to be Bike thieves have been a problem for decades. For whatever it‚Äôs worth, I bought a nice Tern* ebike 6 years ago, bought a heavy kryptonite ulock, and it‚Äôs never gotten stolen. I‚Äôve never left it outside during a 9-5, sure, but it‚Äôs been outside for thousands of miles and it‚Äôs been ok.\n\nIf you buy a ‚Äòcheap‚Äô, say $800 ebike, spend $60 on a nice ulock, there‚Äôs a good chance you won‚Äôt have any problems.¬†\n\nI want all the bike infrastructure too, but it is not theft everyday if you get a good lock and leave your bike where other people are around.",

I didn‚Äôt manage to find my friends but found other friends, and then I caught the bus home by waiting at a stop that had an electric sign. It was very pleasant not to be worrying about my phone. I think similar things have happened during music festivals in the city. Huge crowds stress cell service. Apparently [more than 50,000](https://sfstandard.com/2025/06/14/sf-no-kings-protest/) people came out!\n\nThe other commenter gave great advice. Plan ahead with friends/family for these events so you don't have to rely on your phone in a pinch. Personally I had my phone on me but on airplane mode. I liked being able to be fully present with my community. It always sucks there I suffer every day in the mission I‚Äôm going to switch soon¬† T Mobile always loses connection on Church around 18th & 21st. Drives us nuts.",

Everyone says hide your face or don‚Äôt bring your phone but if I‚Äôm not engaging in any vandalism and am at a lawful protest then why does it matter so much?\n\nEdit: thanks for all the responses and perspectives! (not an expert, purely speculation)\n\nGoing down a few rabbit holes, there is a belief the administration is using Peter Thiel's Palantir for facial recognition.\n\nNow obviously during the day, and the schedule hours 11-2(?), I wouldn't worry. As others have said, show your face and show them you're not afraid, utilize your constitutional rights.\n\nHowever, as the day wears on and the protests become less organized, that's when these things tend to come into play.\n\nThe EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) has some good information regarding security at protests I'd suggest anyone who maybe it's their first time check out. Doesn't hurt to be cautious!\n\nhttps://ssd.eff.org/module/attending-protest\n\nEdit: as u/thisisthewell pointed out, friendly reminder they aren't playing by the rules and dont give a fuck about your rights. Be safe out there today my friends. Don't play into their hands (vandalism, etc) but never let them take away your most basic of rights. That's how they win. Well, there was the time that my friend got put on a no fly list because she protested with Al Sharpton in college. Because this administration is not lawful. This administration seems to have a problem with confusing ‚Äúdisagree with us‚Äù and ‚Äúillegal‚Äù. It‚Äôs for in case this administration continues to bore down the fascism tunnel; you don‚Äôt want your name tied to ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù activity when the secret police start rounding up people. \n\nHyperbolic? Maybe. \n\nBut if you told me 20 years ago that J6 had happened, I would‚Äôve thought you were talking about a dystopian movie‚Ä¶",

Too many protests, which to choose I just arrived at the Tehama street protest (12:41pm) and it's going strong. Protesters have the street blocked on both ends so no traffic through Tehama from 5th to 6th 478 Tehama St is ISAP- listed as \"immigration and naturalization services.\"",

Then we find a spot,could be your place,or somewhere discreet outside. Then we start making out,and I strip you to your jeans,we're necking,I'm licking and flicking your nipples making them rock hard. Then you jerk me off with your sexy feet,suck my dick,then I cum on your feet,face,chest,or maybe all three. Then you can fuck my ass.I like shy guys,thin guys,and muscular/stocky guys,but not fat guys. Prefer other DL guys,but if you are experienced that's cool too. Looking for a guy in the Bay Area or willing to travel.\n\nWhat I look like,tan skin,dark curly hair,139lbs,bout 6ft,slim build. Mixed Black and White.\n\nI'll respond when I can,I'm in danger of being outed at any moment, so I gotta be discreet.

Don‚Äôt be shy let‚Äôs talk and no single males. Unicorns very welcome  Since you‚Äôre in town I‚Äôd highly suggest you attend [Twist SF](https://www.twist-sf.com/) tonight. You‚Äôll likely find many options there. Do you just show up as a couple and pay to get in? Yes. Saturday nights are couples only. I‚Äôm not sure what the exact cover charge is but roughly about 120 maybe 140. But the club is really amazing. One of the better ones on the West Coast.\n\nDoors open at 10. People mingle until roughly midnight and then they open up the play space.\nI think doors close at 3 AM. \n\nNo alcohol is sold. It‚Äôs BYOA. However, there are mixers available such as sodas, etc. And there is a bartender that marks your alcohol and save it for you. There are light snacks available. Chocolates üç´ , fruits üçâ , etc..\n\nThe crowd age is roughly 30 to 50. Traditional Bell curve on attractiveness but very diverse. It‚Äôs highly unlikely you‚Äôd be there and not find anyone that you wouldn‚Äôt click with. \n\nIt‚Äôs a guaranteed sure thing if you‚Äôre in town for tonight. \n\nIf you have any additional questions, feel free to ask me. I‚Äôll be happy to answer.",

Just obedience, hunger, and that proud, messy grin when I‚Äôm finished with you. I want you ready when I come home drunk from the club. When I‚Äôve just finished lifting. Always ready to wake up and drain my morning wood first thing to start your day, then again in the middle of the afternoon. On the beach. In the back of the car. At the park. Anywhere. You‚Äôre not just available,  you ache to serve.\n\nYou‚Äôll be spoiled, flirted with, kissed slow ‚Äî and then flipped, pinned, and filled until you‚Äôre dripping down your thighs and can‚Äôt think straight. I‚Äôll fuck the attitude out of brats, turn good girls into obedient messes, and keep the neediest sluts in a state of constant addiction.\n\nDM with age, location, pics, and how many times a day you‚Äôd let me take you.

Sapiosexual who desires to be micromanaged, spanked/slapped, disciplined and maybe humiliated privately.\n\nA pacifier goes into your mouth and you sleep on the floor when you are not a good gal. You should be on the slender side with curves and a pretty face. A lack of deference towards Me is a good way to get dropped. I can be cruel at times and this should arouse you.\n\nBonus points if you get aroused while giving oral to Me and like to roleplay ‚Äî you enjoy wearing stylish makeup, you‚Äôre multiorgasmic (faking it nicely is acceptable) because I can cum three times in an extended lovemaking with the right person, you're a cuckquean or you are busty to your frame.\n\nExtra bonus points for enjoying free use, domestic discipline, patriarch, CNC, begging and orgasm denial. 56 SWM lean muscled build (5‚Äô11‚Äù), hairy chest and often taken for 40s (recently a colleague who is seven years younger than me said, ‚ÄúWhen you get to be my age you will understand how getting old wears the body down.‚Äù This was his response when I invited him on a seven-mile hike)! Couple of body pics on my feed.\n\nI tend to be a protective teacher Daddy type who obviously enjoys teaching you. It should warm your heart if I start to look out for you outside of the bedroom. My vanilla interests: hot yoga, cultural knowledge, tabletop gaming, video games (preference for Steam), novels, movies & movie trivia, travel, History, red wine, hiking & the many Metaverses. This is a shared fantasy between two consenting adults - 20 or older - probably no older than 43.\n\nThis could go towards an LTR in which case you would sometimes need to act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in public circles. Ideally, you are a clever and pretty woman who likes to privately play out some very naughty fantasies. I tend to lean toward traditional roles in a romantic relationship. If I like you enough to go from online to audio and then in-person you should be vaccinated like me and willing to prove it. Long-term audio partners who are never able to meet might work. When I become exclusive with someone you should understand it means the breaking of our audio interactions - unless it arouses her that I am with other women.\n\nI am exacting and seeking a quality experience. When you contact Me put ‚ÄúExcalibur‚Äù in your detailed message explaining why I should consider you, including a physical description that includes your height, weight, body measurements and dress size.\n\nIf you cannot write at least five sentences to me in your reply I doubt you will get a response. Be ready to voice verify a file to me to prove you are not some guy trolling.\n\n5'11\" 196 lbs athletic build blue eyes dark brown hair.",

I'm open to variations on this idea. Want to just send me some pics and vids and talk about your size / experiences? I'm game. Want to take your exhibitionist side further and flop it out and a public urinal and let me take a gander at your flaccid size? Or let me admire the size of your boner while you stroke to porn? Let me touch it and give you a hand stroking it? All are cool.\n\nHit me up if you're down to show off what you're carrying and let another guy admire your size.\n\nSan Francisco or Oakland",
