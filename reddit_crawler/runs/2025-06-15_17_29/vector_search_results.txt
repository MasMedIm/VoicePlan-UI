  Text: Atlantans from other countries/food cultures, what restaurants serve the best food from your region? What do you order? There was a phenomenal [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/6p1w0h/atlantans_from_other_countries_what_restaurants/) several years back asking people where to find the best food from their countries/cultures. I think it's time to re-visit, see what's still around post-pandemic and what's new.

I'd also like to take it one step further and ask for recommendations on what to order. At many of the places I've visited, menus are difficult  to navigate for an outsider. And, while the staff at almost every place has been welcoming, they are not always super helpful.

**So help us out! What should we order to experience the best of your food culture?** Singha 99 (Dunwoody) - Thai Street Food

Entree
Pla Sahm Rot (aka 3 Flavor Fish, red snapper)  Ribs Massaman, 

Dessert
Mango Sticky Rice

But really, everything on their menu is fantastic. Tassa's Roti shop. 

Best Trinidadian spot in Georgia. Japanese here

For the absolute best sushi go to Sushi Hayakawa. Order the omakase aka the chefs choice. Great place for special occasions. Really pricy though

For ramen I actually like Jinya a lot but its a chain you can find all over so not too special. I honestly cant recommend any local place for their ramen. Theres always one aspect/ingredient that isnt quite right Mariscos La Costa Nayaritas, great seafood and Micheladas.

La Galagetza- decent Oaxacan food

Carnitas michaocan- Carnitas pretty decent...

Tortas factory DF- absolutely good pambazos

Chicago Supermarket - good quesadillas and tacos (they would be absolute great with handmade tortillas üò©) 




Etc etc... Ethiopian: 

* Abol Ethiopian Restaurant 
* Although if you prefer something a little more "Americanized"(sorry, I don't have a better way to put it)  Desta Ethiopian Restaurant 

Food Reccomendations:

* Tibs: Lean cubes of beef sauteed with onions, tomatoes, jalapenos and qibe (Ethiopian butter).  

* Kitfo: Beef Tartare with Spiced Clarified Butter   

* Veggie Combo: 4 to 5 variety of veggie dishes. Swede here. Your options are Ikea, so I guess they win by default? Get the meatballs with mashed potato, gravy, and lingonberry sauce. It's mediocre but very cost effective. 

Bernard's bakery up in Marietta has some swedish pastry and it's pretty damn good and reasonably authentic. There's also Swedishdreamish on Instagram up in Cumming but I haven't tried her stuff. It looks really good though, and I think she's swedish so it should be authentic. Persian food 



Rumi‚Äôs Kitchen-


Kashk badenjoon- eggplant dip with whey 


Sea bass- poached in saffron, amazing 


Koobideh- ground beef kabob, delicious and authentic. 


Tahdig with khoresh ghormeh sabzi- crispy rice with an herb stew 


Mast khiar- yogurt with cucumbers and mint


Persian ice cream sandwich- saffron and cardamom wafers with rose water/saffron/pistachio ice cream





Delbar is also amazing- 


All of the above but also:


Dill labneh


Adas polo- rice with lentils, raisins, and caramelized onions - the best I have ever had and I‚Äôve had it everywhere 


Stuffed fish- grilled whole fish with a pomegranate walnut stew inside Aladdin in sandy springs (not the Emory one) has the best Arabic food, with Jerusalem bakery a 2nd place. Northern China Eatery on Buford has boiled dumplings that husband said taste just like his mom‚Äôs homemade ones and the Shanghai soup dumplings are better than ones we‚Äôve had in China. 

We also love XiAn Gourmet House inside the JusGo Supermarket up in Duluth. Not quite as flavorful as you might find on the street in XiAn, but their paomo is as close as we‚Äôve found in Atlanta, and their cumin lamb burgers and persimmon cakes are spot on. Bangladeshi:  
Bismillah Cafe! Get some chicken somosas, kaleji (liver) samosas and mutton biryani

  Text: Atlantans not born in the U.S.--which restaurant makes the best food from your home country? I saw this in /r/portland and thought it might be fun, now that snowpacolypse has been a giant bust. It would be great to know the best places to get truly authentic food!  Pho Bac and Pho Dai Loi make my favorite bowls of pho. Their other noodle offerings are good, too. Com tam suon nuong is great there, too (ask for a fried egg on top). As far as Viet places go, generally the more hole in the wall the better, since it's all street food. Although I would highly recommend making your own pho; it's extremely easy and you can freeze broth for the winter. If you guys haven't had a home made bowl of pho, you're missing out.

Quoc Huong makes the best traditional banh mi. Cash only. Old Asian ladies there to yell at you. Runs out of sandwiches occasionally. Closed randomly on Thursdays. An authentic Vietnamese experience. I recommend the pate xiu mai or thit nuong if you are not as adventurous. Better than Lee's. 

For ITP, We Suki Suki in East Atlanta is OK. The lady running the place is nice (but crazy), and their sandwiches are good, but at $6 a pop it ain't cheap. Not sure how she sources her ingredients, but I don't think it's local so not really worth it to me. 

Last time I was at Fred's in Krog Street Market they had a roasted cauliflower and eggplant banh mi that was absolutely delicious-- all the right pickle flavors and sauces. Definitely worth a try.

Dua (Vietnamese for chopsticks) in downtown is OK. Nothing great, just standard fare. A nice lunch spot. 

I urge everyone to try things that aren't pho. Pho is a young dish; it hasn't really gotten to mature and age into something phenomenal like other noodle dishes. Try: bun bo hue (my favorite), mi xao muc (stir fried noodles with squid), bun rieu (crab paste tomato vermicelli), bun cha gio thit nuong (vermicelli with bbq pork + eggrolls), or any number of the rice dishes.  The Manchester Arms is the closest you generally get to proper English pub food. Fado does a good English/Irish breakfast, you really have to try their black pudding!  Saw some requests for Indian recommendations. I haven't really had good Indian food ITP, but as a Bangladeshi I highly recommend Panahar on Buford highway. It's
 BYOB and family owned. The saag phoneer can rival any India version and the korma is delicious. Honestly, everything on their menu is mouthwatering. I also recommend Purima, another excellent Bangladeshi restaurant on Buford Highway. Purima has fantastic lamb biryani and quail, so random, but great. Cuban here...Papi's has great Cuban food. Most of the servers are Cuban as well. I have only been to the Midtown Ponce location, but they have multiple locations around town. http://panburys.com/index.html  

These guys do the best English pork pies and steak pies.  Pataks www.patakmeats.com/ in Austell  also has a 'Scottish' Banger which  is a typical English Sausage.    Not Atlanta, but the [Australian Bakery](http://www.australianbakerycafe.com) in the Marietta Square makes some really freaking good meat pies.  They really need to sell chips with chicken salt and kebabs for the full Aussie beach experience, but nowhere else are you going to get that fresh mince. Japanese Here. Recently moved to Atlanta, May 2014. Found a few really good, few really bad Japanese places. I like Shoya Izakaya right off i285, exit 31a, Haru Ichiban in Duluth, and Umezono off Windy Hill. Haven't found truly authentic ramen yet, Any suggestions?  [On the Bayou](http://www.onthebayousmyrna.com/) in Smyrna has the most authentic New Orleans food I have found in Atlanta.  
  
And yes, while Louisiana is not another country, the food is very distinct & widely imitated very poorly, so I think it somewhat qualifies the same as food from another country. Hey mods, can we get this added to the FAQ?

Edit: I'll also add Coisas do Brasil in Alpharetta for a great, quick lunch.  And, of course, Fogo de Ch√£o for the best churrasco. Persian here - It used to be Rumi's for me. Now i'm not so sure. The food is still really good but I know a few people who work there and they make it seem like the owner treats them like garbage. If you want good food though you should go. I'm not sure what is better than Rumi's as far as food goes but I'd rather not go there anymore.

**So help us out! What should we order to experience the best of your food culture?** Las Delicias de La Abuela in Doraville is pretty good Colombian food.
On the weekends they sell Ajiaco üî• Korean culture is well represented and available all over metro Atlanta, but below are some of my recommendations:

-Stone Bowl(Ïö∞ÎÇ®Ï†ï) in Doraville for traditional dishes
-A-Hyang in Duluth for Korean snack & traditional food
-Danmooji(Îã®Î¨¥ÏßÄ) is probably a favorite spot for others
-678 for Korean bbq or K-Factory(same owners) for larger groups is also located in Duluth
-Seorabeol(ÏÑúÎùºÎ≤å) is a 24 hour Korean restaurant(2 am is usually my time spot for Waffle House, but sometimes you need that spicy beef stew)
-Arte 3 in Suwanee or Hansel & Gretel in Duluth have a great selection of Korean desserts(shaved ocean, waffles, etc.) 

Lemme know if you want more suggestions. Kurt‚Äôs or Biergarten probably have the best German food. Northern China Eatery (As someone from Shenyang, China) Venezuelan here to confirm that arepa m√≠a is legit although it hurts to see the arepa prices - they are supposed to be the equivalent of a street hot dog with price to match. However, their ingredients are as authentic as you'll find a stateside (I understand they ship through Miami), and the portions are at least generous. More broadly, arepita Cafe in Alpharetta has more of the traditional dishes and style, including hallacas during Xmas time (think semi sweet tamales but in banana leaf instead of corn husk). Definitely recommend trying them out too Being originally from New Hampshire, I have to say I have yet to find a place that does authentic overcooked-until-it‚Äôs-fibrous chicken tenders with unseasoned boiled vegetables. Nobody wanted or asked for British fast food in this thread but.....

Wright's Fish and Chips in Cumming.  

They're closed right now because they're moving to a new location in town but they're an actual, authentic British chippy. The only one I've ever found in the USA and for sure the only one in/around the metro area.  Apparently the family who run it used to run a chippy back home which I don't doubt for a second.  It's *genuinely* authentic.

Is it healthy?  Erm... No. Is it greasy British comfort food?  Heck yes...  When they reopen, fish & chips and curry sauce is where it's at.  Or maybe try the battered sausage....

---

[edit] Well, apparently there's some love for British stuff in this thread.  On the off chance you didn't know about [Taste of Britain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taste+of+Britain/@33.9413067,-84.2132371,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc9035231f0d2cd30?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC3ruNt-D4AhXXkGoFHU1vBzAQ_BJ6BAhgEAU) in Norcross, you're welcome.... Bangaldeshi here and you'll find the best Bangladeshi food (outside of Jackson Heights in NYC) in Atlanta.

Al Amin (Buford Highway) - Order the 'Kachchi' (variant of a mutton biriyani) on Saturdays (only) and 'Beef Tehari' (beef biriyani variant, everyday). They're biriyani-like but the flavor profile in still significantly different.

Purnima (Buford Highway) - Order the 'Morog Polao' (variant of a chicken biriyani)

All three items are better than most places back in Bangladesh (verified by multiple friends and family members) Egyptian American here and best mediterranean Id had was Aladdins Mediterranean Grill off Roswell Rd. Grew up going there but it closed during the pandemic. Please recommend me something else :'(

- West Egg Cafe
- Cultivate
- Le Fat
- Slim+Husky
- L.O.A. Social Club
- Superica

And at nearby Westside Paper:

- Boxcar Betty's
- Elsewhere Brewing
- Bar Diver
- Pancake Social (listed for sale)


Not good at all... The main culprit is the rent cost for these spaces. I bet they are not cheap and the foot traffic needs to be high to justify. 

If we lose Ormsbys, its over. I miss when Octane was the main event on the Westside. It's grown too fast and has too much of the same boring restaurant repeating itself over there. Hate to see some of the good original spots are going down to make room for shitty chains. NORTHSIDE TAVERN LIVES ON! I'm still so hurt losing Little Trouble 2023 :(


I live in midtown and lament how cool the area seems for all the development but how hard it it's to get over there. Some additional bike and public transit access would make a huge difference for people like me. In a just world we'd get some kind of Marta rail access. I‚Äôm all for density but everything on  that stretch of Howell mill was poorly planned for a car driven city. As much as we try to push away from being car centric there is no easy way outside of biking to get here which blows my mind because there‚Äôs an entire Marta bus facility right there. Parking at the interlock is the second highest in the city (not to be beat by non validating at colony square) and Westside paper doesn‚Äôt have the foot traffic to drive a large amount of customers. A shame really. In the inevitable downturn we're barreling towards, this district is going to get scary, fast

I live like a mile away and it's such a pain in the ass to get in and out of, there was less than zero thought about infrastructure. Like forget a MARTA stop they didn't even widen or straighten out the cow trail that is Howell Mill Holy cow! I didn‚Äôt realize there were that many. As an Eastsider I avoid that area at all costs because it‚Äôs such a pain to get to/get out of while driving and a minimum $30 uber each way if I want to have a cocktail. I was at dinner in IP recently and heard a group of 30 something‚Äôs saying the same thing at the table next to us. Pancake social was stupid. Their excessively priced model led to closure. So, no love lost on that one. That is a hell of a lot of restaurants in a concentrated space. I have always thought Atl supports their restaurants very well Thursday through Saturday, but can be empty Sunday through Wednesday.

Anyone else successfully eaten in the stadium GF? They do, in fact, have GF Mac and cheese.  The real question is‚Ä¶ do you hate yourself enough to put it in your mouth.  If you do, please see a therapist. 

Generally speaking, the stadium and vendors do genuinely try.  That said, if you have a serious allergy or celiac, I strongly recommend sticking with the tequila. Chicken wings, perhaps Nachos are great. Corn chips only. They load them up at the place close to section 105-108 GF here and been to many games. It's very doable. Just have to look around a bit. GF Mac n cheese is... ok. But there are bowls, etc. there used to be a vegan/GF specific stand near 205 but I believe they closed down. The GF Mac & cheese is also vegan (fake cheese). Near there is So Ko Me, which is hibachi so it‚Äôs rice ‚Äî it‚Äôs really good. Next to that is the Jamaican place, also really good. Lettuce wrapped burgers is another choice.  We have family members severely allergic and they never have a problem finding something decent to eat.  

Always ask about whether the fries are done in dedicated oil or if it's shared oil. They have gluten free hamburger and hot dog buns! Nothing to write home about, and sometimes you have to time it right for them to have some. They exist though!

There‚Äôs also a little taco stand called Tacos & Margaritas that do their tacos on corn tortillas. Been a favorite of mine lately. I know in the clubs they have shrimp and chicken wings. The place that sells lobster rolls can obviously leave the bun off. It's not me, a family member. But one thing you learn when you have a GF family member is if you want to eat you suck it up and eat the crappy replacement. I don't do gluten-free but I do keto. The wings from West Nest are the best in the stadium IMO. Williamson Bros are not bad

What are everyone‚Äôs favorite spots to hit before the game, favorite adult beverage, or food prior or in stadium?  I take Marta to the games so the walk from Garnett to Wild Leap isn‚Äôt that bad. I prefer Atlantucky‚Äôs vibe to WL, however, so if you make the trek to Northside Drive the beer and food options at Atlantucky are pretty good. 

I‚Äôm not sure anything will beat pre and post game vibes at Elliott St Pub, though. That was the spot for drinks, food, and music before and after games. My brother and I still walk by and grumble that the new owner of the building (Cam Newton) seems to have done nothing with the property. If you can get to Wild Leap with enough time to add the walk to and from, it‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôve also enjoyed the Hilton across the Home Depot lot. They‚Äôve got a sports bar with a live UTD podcast and a solid cocktail bar downstairs. Manny‚Äôs! Nice little pub with killer burgers and wings. Usually have some soccer game on tv if it can be found I‚Äôm a normie. We always hit up Der Biergarten. Good vibes. Supporter‚Äôs Tailgate for sure! It‚Äôs a little hidden compared to where we used to be in the Gulch but still like a 5-10 min walk to the stadium (depending on which entrance you wanna go in through i.e. by the falcon or the soccer ball sculpture). There‚Äôs multiple supporter ran bars (some are free and others cost $10 for unlimited drinks). There‚Äôs also a bunch of food vendors there (some free & some charge). They also sometimes have vendors like Sweetwater, etc come out and they give out free drinks, swag, food. 

There‚Äôs a couple DJs there, tents & fans to stay cool, plus TVs playing other big football & soccer matches depending on what else is going on at the time (especially during college football season). There‚Äôs also a lot of different vibes that go on as well like people (kids especially) playing soccer with each other, people dancing, there was even a drag show last season if that‚Äôs your thing.

Best part (besides the free drinks) is all the supporter chants and the march to the stadium with the supporters! The address is 550 Mitchell St SW, Atlanta, GA 30313 to keep it easy for you! Supporters groups tailgate 100% of the time. Especially for the group with free beer, liquor, and food every match üòé I go to the supporters tailgate prematch.

Best food in the stadium is the brisket grilled cheese from Hot Press Xpress. If you typically take MARTA(or are unopposed to doing so), at least a couple of times a season I park at Edgewood-Candler deck(free daily) and eat at Bonafide Deluxe. I‚Äôve only been to Park Bar once, but I really liked the food and the pregame vibes Pre-game routine with our 3.5-year old is a lot different than it was from 2017-2019. We used to get to the lot (Elliot Street Pub lot) 3-4 hours before kickoff, host/meet friends there for a bunch of drinks and then go watch us wreck the opponent (mostly). Every game, double bourbon on the rocks for the walk over to the stadium.

Now, we get to the parking lot (different lot, over across from Wild Leap) only about an hour before kickoff. I still have a double bourbon for the walk, but now it's after one or no beers instead of several. 

We get 2 Miller Lites for me and my wife and a box of popcorn for my daughter before every game. My kid insists on listening to "We Ready" in the car on the way to the game now. Every time.

  Text: New Food Options for 2024 at MBS I am somewhat of a foodie who has tried pretty much every restaurant at MBS from its opening.  Every year there are a few new food spots that come to MBS.  I haven't been able to find a list of any new places for 2024.  Does any know of any new food spots for 2024? Just looking on the ATLUTD app I noticed a nacho place that I think is new? Here‚Äôs a list of all of their food options: https://www.mercedesbenzstadium.com/all-vendors What are your favorite spots or dishes? The grill has definitely downgraded their tenders. RIP real chicken tenders at the grill. I'm hoping for more stadium shaped food like the nachos! It feels like stadium food options have gone downhill. I wish there were healthier options (not-so-sodium-laden, something with vegetables other than potato). I saw an instagram ad for a street taco place. Can‚Äôt remember the name though. Could be.  There is a place called El Santo Gallo that I haven't heard before.  I think that may be it. The Cuban sandwich kinda near team store. Depends on what I have a taste for.  One of these in no particular order

  The farm burger for burgers. Moes for nachos.  Hot press grilled cheese and brisket.  West Nest for lemon pepper wings.  4 rivers for pulled pork sandwich.  Miss D's for popcorn

  Text: Best way to relocate from San Diego to Central New York with two cats and a car? I am currently thinking about using u-haul or a similar shipping company to move my belongings, having my car shipped, and renting an RV for me and my cats and make a road trip out of it. I really want to go to the Grand Canyon and the petrified forest again before I‚Äôm on the other side of the country.

A non-negotiable for me is that my cats have to stay with me and I am not going to drive for a week or more with two cats in my car. I‚Äôm fine with a long road trip, but not in my car. I‚Äôm not going to stress about having to drive ten hours a day to make it there in under a week.

Additionally, flying to NY and shipping my belongings isn‚Äôt a good option because I would be without my belongings for about two weeks either way you slice it which is why I want to road trip it. 

I really don‚Äôt want to haul anything either. I‚Äôm already going to be stressed enough driving across the country with two cats. The last thing I want is to be nervous about a trailer tipping over or something. I‚Äôve driven through Arizona, NM and Colorado before and I know I will be driving through mountains and open desert having to pass hundreds of semis and I remember white knuckling it a lot because the wind made me feel like I was going to get blown off the road.

I will not stay at somebody‚Äôs else‚Äôs house while I wait for my belongings either. One of my cats has a condition that‚Äôs triggered by stress that can be fatal quickly. A cross country move followed by hopping around from new strange place to new strange place is the worst thing I could put them through, especially because my parents have three cats of their own. 

There may be no better way to do this but if anybody has recommendations, I‚Äôm open. Ideally, I would love a trustworthy and reliable company that would be able to ship my belongings and my car instead of going through two different companies.

Wanted to see any things to know food wise or any insight around the stadium.  Eat in the stadium. Food is good there. The texas grilled cheese with brisket.  So messy, so greasy, so amazing. The Mac and Cheese at the stadium with the brisket is top tier The prices in the stadium you almost can‚Äôt beat 

I can get some decent chicken tenders, fries, and a refillable drink till the 75th minute for 8$ Depending on how you're planning on getting to the game and/or how much of a day you want to make of it there are countless great options walking distance from several blue line MARTA stops.

Bonafide Deluxe right by Edgewood/Candler station is my go to, but Fox Bros, Kitty Dare, Wrecking Bar, Hattie B's, Delbar, Beetlecat, Bread & Butterfly, bartaco, are all a 5-15 minute walk from various stations. Hell Krog Street Market would be a 20 minute walk max(probably a little less) or the Decatur station lets out right by a ton of options(Brick Store FTW). Der Biergarten is my favorite restaurant around there. I usually hit it on the way in and the Waffle House downstairs on the way out. Bottlerocket! Great sushi and beer. Always United fans in there. Usually the marching band passes by before the game. Can usually find free parking close-ish. 10 min walk to stadium. My favorite is Hsus Chinese near the Hard Rock. It‚Äôs only 1.3 miles away and they validate enough parking for the game. Nearby we like Tyde Tate Kitchen (Thai food) on Mitchell Street before games.  Bottlerocket for after the match. Places I would recommend in no particular order:

Skol Brewing, Bottle Rocket, Park Bar, Top Draft, Der Biergarten, Max‚Äôs Coal Oven, Wild Leap, Tyde Tate Kitchen, Signia- for drinks only 

Places I would avoid like the plague: Stats, McCormick & Schmicks, Hudson Grille, Margaritaville, No Mas Cantina(over priced and mediocre)

https://www.nba.com/hawks/barnetwork#bars  I mean if we can‚Äôt find one maybe let‚Äôs make a bar the spot? Not sure how many of us actually live here but maybe it‚Äôs enough to show up in numbers and have a good time! I‚Äôve started defaulting to Hudson Grille (little five points). Not a crazy atmosphere but there‚Äôs people in there and lots of TVs. Unfortunately the Hawks do not have a sustained enough culture in Atlanta to draw a crowd for a Tuesday night game in November. You will not find any Hawks centric bars. ¬†There are some bars where you will probably see a handful of hawks people around, those are -¬†

STATS (downtown)¬†
Dugans (off Ponce)¬†
Benchwarmers (Decatur)¬†
Sport and Social (the Battery)¬†

And some others. ¬†Personally, I like Midway Pub in EAV. ¬†Never tried to watch the Hawks there, though. I honestly dont know of any. A few years ago when the Hawks were in the Conference Finals I went with some friends to 3 Dollar Cafe. They had like 30 TVs, and all were either playing an NFL classic game or showing whatever was on ESPN. We asked to turn it to the Hawks game and it look like 20 minutes for someone to change it. 

I would love to find a bar with the atmosphere you see for other teams. Everyone huddled around the tvs cheering or groaning in unison. Manny‚Äôs in Grant Park - Boulevard and Woodward
. I don't know if it's around anymore but when I would visit my brother we would watch Hawks games at a bar called Sidebar in Downtown not far from Centennial Park. The food was good and they had plenty of TVs. This would be sick. I‚Äôve yelled at my tv alone for too long. Well...someone else mentioned the Hudson Grille in Little 5. That sounds like a good starting point to me. Clays on Roswell Rd is pretty great. I would suggest there. I‚Äôd be down!

Exactly 1 year ago, I set a goal to build¬†**12 projects**¬†as an indie hacker. Today, I‚Äôm sharing the results‚Äîwhat worked, what flopped, and what I learned.

# My projects included:

üîπ AI-powered social media posting web app  
üîπ Telegram mini-app for building online stores  
üî∏¬†**15 Chrome Extensions**¬†(only 1 hit¬†**2,000+ weekly users**)

# The Hardest Projects

The most challenging were:

1. **Telegram Mini-App**¬†(Java + Spring) ‚Äì A no-code store builder for Telegram.
2. **AI Social Media Poster**¬†(Go + Svelte) ‚Äì Automated posting with AI-generated content.

Both took¬†**\~3 months each**¬†and used completely different tech stacks. For the AI poster, I relied on AI for code generation but had to manually:

* Fine-tune API integrations (Twitter, Instagram, etc.).
* Implement role-based auth.
* Design a scalable database.

**Result?**¬†Despite the effort, both projects stalled at¬†**a few dozen users**.

# My Biggest Mistake

I built the product¬†**first**, then looked for a market. Due to high competition, the unit economics didn‚Äôt work, and I had to shut them down.

# What Actually Worked

For Chrome Extensions, I flipped the approach:

1. **Validated market demand first**¬†(e.g., Reddit tools, productivity hacks).
2. **Then built the product**.

Out of 15 extensions, only 1 crossed¬†**2,000+ users** [Flowchart Maker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/flowchart-maker/npiiinidjjddnffoiopbkncedkkhhbia) ‚Äîbut this method had a¬†**much higher success rate**.

# Key Takeaways

‚úîÔ∏è¬†**Market > Product**¬†‚Äì Build what people¬†*already*¬†need.  
‚úîÔ∏è¬†**Simple > Complex**¬†‚Äì Chrome Extensions scaled faster than monolithic apps.  
‚úîÔ∏è¬†**AI isn‚Äôt magic**¬†‚Äì It saves time, but integrations are still manual.

  Text: Why so few food trucks and hot dog stands in Atlanta? I have lived in about 10 major cities and this city has by far the fewest. Is there laws against certain locations like piedmont park? Feel like something there would make a killing. So few late night places to grab slices too. Food trucks are illegal to operate like an actual food truck here. My understanding is that they need to have permits for a specific location. You can't just set up where it makes sense and move around every day. There's a lot more permitting required. There used to be a food truck park on Howell Mill / 75N. I think that was one of the firsts but they used that land to build apartments I think. You have a food truck park now in some towns (I think Smyrna has one) during summer times once a week but not sure anymore. I used to work at a place with few buildings surrounding a 'court yard' and few food trucks used to come once a week to serve employees from all those buildings. Now, it's very rare and like everyone said, location, permits etc. I stopped going because of the price. It's just too expensive for the quality/quantity of the food. Also, COVID might have something to do with it as well. Restaurants taxes are a big chunk of the city budget.  The Council is hesitant to allow food trucks to compete with them.  I get the sentiment, but they go way too far to the extent that we can't really have food trucks. I have seen people out with smokers and such just selling food on the weekends. They don't have permits and yeah they pack up if a cop makes them scram but they exist. West end also has a bunch of folks around selling whatever. Hell my sister and my mom used to sell meatloaf sandwiches and brownies out of a trunk like a decade ago. No permit just vibes 

I see it east side in the less gentrified neighborhoods (Wesley chapel, candler road, Glenwood, Columbia drive, etc) but a few Sundays ago a dude was parked outside Grady hospital with a smoker selling bbq sandwiches. Nurses and cops were buying from him so maybe he has an arrangement. Shame he didn't take cards. 

TLDR: street food exists but it's not as big and formal as a food truck or even stands. Just folks with food they made and some chips from sam's club. Lived in Seattle and NYC for a bit. You‚Äôre hard pressed to find a sandwich under $15 at a food truck in Seattle.   Lived in NYC more recently, and there were lots of ‚Äústreet meat‚Äù trucks in Manhattan, but not a ton of interesting variety to me.  There are a few food trucks in Atlanta with steady spots.  A taco stand on Peachtree by the Bank of America by W. Paces and a Jamaican truck near the gas station on Peachtree near Collier.  

I would love a food truck park to return like the one that used to be on Howell Mill.  Maybe they can take over the WalMart parking lot this spring since that store is closed/closing due to the fire? A lot of people are commenting about food trucks and regulations and these are mostly incorrect now. Under House Bill 14-43, food trucks only need one permit to operate in the whole of Georgia as of January this year. Now finding a location is still up to the truck but at least the regulations have gotten streamlined, I just see food trucks at breweries n stuff but yeah it just feels like a bigass suburb when there‚Äôs no street food anywhere. There has to be a thriving food truck scene in Atlanta.  Generally the only time I stumble upon a food truck or stand, it‚Äôs a marketed event with several food trucks for the masses. 

If you‚Äôre asking why you can‚Äôt a go a few blocks and hit a food truck or stand on every other corner, I honestly have the same question.  Having lived in Atlanta for a few decades, I can anecdotally guess:

Atlanta city government makes it onerous to operate food trucks and stands in any given spot over time. I only see food trucks when there is a city hosted event and they are ‚Äúallowed‚Äù.  I also imagine there is a strong restaurant lobby/influence to curb food truck patronage. 

Being a pedestrian outside of parks in Atlanta is usually miserable due to cars everywhere, ‚Äònot-nice‚Äô areas, weather/climate, hills, crime, crumbling or no sidewalks etc.  This would likely limit areas where food trucks can operate with enough demand to make a profit. 

If I had a food truck just a block away from where I worked I wouldn‚Äôt want to deal with any of the obstacles/barriers listed above when I could just  to hop in the sheltered car with an air conditioner and get togo. Regulations, locations, population concentrations, and food halls at every corner.  Also nobody is really interested in waiting in a line outside in the middle of the summer to get a $23 *artisian* grilled cheese sandwich.

  Text: Cursor vs Windsurf vs Firebase Studio ‚Äî What‚Äôs Your Go-To for Building MVPs Fast? I‚Äôm currently building a productivity SaaS (online integrated EdTech platform), and tools that help me code fast with flow have become a major priority.

I used to be a big fan of Cursor, loved the AI-assisted flow but ever since the recent UX changes and the weird lag on bigger files, I‚Äôve slowly started leaning towards Windsurf. Honestly, it‚Äôs been super clean and surprisingly good for staying in the zone while building out features fast.

Also hearing chatter about Firebase Studio ‚Äî haven‚Äôt tested it yet, but wondering how it stacks up, especially for managing backend + auth without losing momentum.

Curious ‚Äî what tools are you all using for ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù lately?

Would love to hear real-world picks from folks shipping MVPs or building solo/small team products.

  Text: Anything better than the default marketplace for selling things? I have this idea that it would be easier to manage and possibly easier to browse if one could make a landing page of sorts or a page with all the items you want to sell for your move listed and just a marketplace ad linking people to that page/site from which they could contact you directly however you chose. Is that crazy? We're in Montreal. Any ideas on best ways to sell several items? Roughly 70 items. All shapes and weights and sizes.

  Text: Rest restaurants walking distance to Mercedes Benz Stadium? My husband and I are looking for a nicer restaurant to eat for lunch before a game on Saturday. A lot of the restaurants we‚Äôve been looking at open after 4, which is when the game starts. Does anyone have any recommendations for a bit more upscale restaurant that is walking distance to the stadium and open for lunch? None! There really isn‚Äôt anything upscale that‚Äôs open at lunch. The closest places to the stadium that are closest to your criteria are Ted‚Äôs (next to the Tabernacle) Max‚Äôs Coal Oven or Biergarten. 

Everything else is a bar that serves food. Someone will inevitably recommend No Mas but it‚Äôs not that good and crazy expensive for what it is. By George on peachtree is fancy and has brunch til 2:30 on Saturdays. Longer walk or a quick scooter ride to the stadium. I don‚Äôt know how nice it would be considered, but Park Bar has good food and drinks and is walkable! Upscale? Not in the stadium zone. Based on what time you need, I‚Äôd suggest Teds Montana Grill on Luckie. About 8-10 min walk from stadium. I haven‚Äôt had a bad meal there. A bit more upscale varies but I like Hsus Chinese food, Capital Grill, and Alma Covina.  They‚Äôre about a 15 minute walk so pretty easy. I like Bottle Rocket. Upscale sushi spot Closest upscale would be ruth chris or mccormick?

Edit: but those aren‚Äôt open at the time you are looking for I believe. So maybe 4 or 5 star hotels near the stadium would be the best bet Ray's in the City

  Text: [P] A chrome extension to remove slop from the internet Hey guys I was getting tired of having 90% of my google searches returning slop so I decided to create a chrome extension to tag them.

For the model I basically scrapped some websites for slop vs non-slop, then used those to train a custom implementation of fasttext with additional features, pruned and optimized until I got a very fast, lightweight model.

I gotta say the results are not 100% perfect (the model is pretty simple and the task, pretty complex), but I'm pretty happy with the results.

  Text: Tried all the AI figma plugins but none delivered, so we made our own-share your thoughts Not sure why i even expected anything different, but i spent the last couple weeks trying out every figma plugin that claims to ‚Äúmagically‚Äù turn screenshots into components. figured it‚Äôd be a nice shortcut for rebuilding some old UI screens. you know save a few hours, avoid the pixel pushing.

instead, i got a couple of half-baked tools.

stuff that either flattens everything into a mess, guesses wrong on 90% of the structure, or breaks entirely if the screenshot isn‚Äôt from a perfect Dribbble post. bonus points if they make you pay $30/month just to find out it can‚Äôt even handle a login screen.

At some point i just gave up and texted couple of friends like ‚Äúok what if we just built the version of this we actually wish existed?‚Äù

so we did.

kept it super simple drop in a screenshot, get back clean figma components with real auto layout, text layers, nested frames, the works. it‚Äôs not magic and we‚Äôre not pretending it is. but it works way better than anything else we tried. it‚Äôs already saving us a ton of time.

we‚Äôve been dogfooding it for a bit, and now we‚Äôre getting it ready to share. no hype, just a tool that does the thing it says it does.

if you‚Äôve been burned by these plugins too and want to try something that actually respects your time, we‚Äôve got a waitlist up. no pressure.

just figured i‚Äôd put it out there in case someone else is tired of the¬†nonsense¬†too

  Text: [P] Best Approach for Accurate Speaker Diarization I'm developing a tool that transcribes recorded audio with timestamps and speaker diarization, and I've gotten decent results using `gemini`. It has provided me with accurate transcriptions and word-level timestamps, outperforming other hosted APIs I've tested.

However, the speaker diarization from the Gemini API isn't meeting the level of accuracy I need for my application. I'm now exploring the best path forward specifically for the diarization task and am hoping to leverage the community's experience to save time on trial-and-error.

Here are the options I'm considering:

1. **Other All-in-One APIs:** My initial tests with these showed that both their transcription and diarization were subpar compared to Gemini.
2. **Specialized Diarization Models (e.g.,** `pyannote`**, NeMo):** I've seen these recommended for diarization, but I'm skeptical. Modern LLMs are outperforming alot of the older, specialized machine learning models . Are tools like `pyannote` genuinely superior to LLMs *specifically for diarization*?
3. `WhisperX`**:** How does `WhisperX` compare to the native diarization from Gemini, a standalone tool like `pyannote`, or the other hosted APIs?

Would love to get some insights on this if anyone has played around with these before. 

Or 

If there are hosted APIs for `pyannot, nemo` or `WhisperX` that I can test out quickly, that'd be helpful too.

Now that Sam lowered the price of o3, I gave it a shot, it is much slower than Claude or Gemini, but fixed it in one shot! I am amazed!

  Text: What are you guys/gals using for automated lead generation? I will not promote i will not promote "i will not promote" Clay seems really nice - it has a bunch of data sources you can pull in and filter by. Things like company size, reviews, funding. You can enrich the company leads with contacts, emails, etc by role. It's really expensive, though, especially for ideas that havent reached revenue yet. (I'm just trying to validate ideas before I even build).

I ended up standing up a quick local application that is very very basic in nature. It can query google through their api (im querying for sites like trustPilot looking for specific phrases to indicate pain in a certain area), hits builtWith so I can filter on tech stack (see who uses stripe, etc), and hits another api to get contact information for the company.

I feel like there must be something more lightweight and inexpensive than Clay without rolling my own thing or doing it manually though?

Also, mods - JC with these requirements to post. My post has been deleted 3 times despite it being in the title

I will not promote. i will not promote. I WILL NOT PROMOTE "i will not promote" 'i will not promote' \`i will not promote\`
