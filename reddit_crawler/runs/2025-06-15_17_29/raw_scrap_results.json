But they have like 3 places with top notch pizza. We have like 50‚Ä¶. I feel like if it were true you wouldn‚Äôt need a billboard to tell people. The CT tourism board is trying to attract tourists from NYC by offending them? I grew up in CT.  Sorry CT, the pizza there is mid at best. Just look at the sign and do a shaking your head chuckle, and move on, as it should be. ‚Äúcome to our state‚Äôs one elite spot, 4 really good places, and a rotating trendy one- conveniently, all in the same city!‚Äù Connecticut thinks a calzone is an italian sportscar.\n\nNobody goes out of their way to go to CT for a pizza unless you are stuck in traffic on 95. Pizza has a radius, the further away from NYC the shitter it gets there are a few exceptions to the rule but generally it is true truth A city that has a million pizza spots will inevitably have a bunch of really good ones. It will also have a lot of really shitty ones. Some of the best pizza I‚Äôve had has been in NY. I‚Äôve also had some of the worst in NY. Some of the best pizza I‚Äôve had has also been outside of NY I think there is mutual respect between NY and New Haven when it comes to pizza. Chicago can fuck off with it's deep dish.",

Hopefully Dominoes is next. It's been a long time coming.  I love spotting the new restaurants in the old pizza huts painted weird colors. Apparently everyone out pizza'd the Hut... I dont know why the hut refuses to embrace delivery in NY and keeps pushing these restaurants...I worked in a restaurant when i was 17 and im now 35.  In NY where many areas have 10 non chain pizza spots in the area that all deliver you expect people to dine in?  You arent applebees.  Deliver that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts a shame cuz I really do think their za is the best out of all the corporate places.  Only thing even close was some papa johns I had in virginia but that was many moons ago. I favor the individual pizza shops over chain locations for all the obvious reasons, although I gotta say sometimes that lunch buffet Pizza Hut offered was perfect. I used to deliver fresh fruits and vegetables once a week when I lived in North Carolina, and my last stop was near a Pizza Hut. After lugging boxes in and out of my car for 4 hours I‚Äôd often stop in and do the buffet. For like $12 you got all you can eat pizza and pasta as well as a drink. Deep dish, pan, thin crust.. it was all there. Definitely not the best pizza, but not bad either. For $12 it was perfect. I hope they open some cool restaurants in place.  Like Thai Mii Up. Good!  I have had Pizza Hut 3 times in 2 states in the last 15 years. Every single time I got food poisoning.  \n\nFirst one was one near me in CT, food poisoning. Next one was 7 years later, at a different location in CT, food poisoning. And the final time, was on Long Island two years ago. Again food poisoning. \n\nPizza Hut sucks. If you want chain store pizza dominos has gotten immensely better, but I say stop being cheap and get one from a mom and pop shop where pizza is a million times better. \n\nRant over, sorry TIL this sub was a thing",

I worked at a similar spot that was 20k a month and also in 200k debt pre corona. But the owner is Teflon so it's still open somehow. If we wait 3 years and the read the balance sheet on this building, we will find that the landlord will have received less rent on this space, then he would have if he forgave the 198k and let them stay for 20k a month. I fully expect to see a year or two of vacancy, before they settle for 15k a month. Louisa is going to see Little of that $200k. My question is, do the landlords expect to get this money? Do they really think the pizza place has it and wouldn‚Äôt just declare bankruptcy? Not only that, if they pushed the pizza place out, do they really expect to get someone else in that spot soon?\n\nI used to work for a company that did office spaces and we never had someone ready to take over when we had a client who couldn‚Äôt pay anymore.

You could walk along it in an hour. But still, it was - it was a paradise for us. One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait, and the rats would come for the coconut, and...they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you've trapped all the rats. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it. And they begin to get hungry, and one by one... they will start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees. But now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now they only eat rat. Keeping the subways clean!

Paramedics showed up and started giving him CPR.'\n\nThe victim, who is believed to have been in his 40s, was taken to Bellevue Hospital and declared dead at 9.40pm.¬†\n\nThere has been an uptick in crime in the city amid the pandemic.¬†\n\nAccording to [**NYPD statistics**](https://compstat.nypdonline.org/2e5c3f4b-85c1-4635-83c6-22b27fe7c75c/view/90) as of Saturday there has been 405 murders so far this year compared to 295 for the same period in 2019.

Obviously had been here before but being here every day I saw a lot of shit. \n\nHomeless / mentally ill screaming at people, some dude charged me on the sidewalk across from Macy‚Äôs for no reason, and then all the people just staggering around doing a zombie walk. Crazy this all happens within a block of the precinct on 30th street and they do... nothing. I lived in this area for 2 years before the pandemic... it used to be pretty sketchy at night but as a whole has REALLY declined since March.

I‚Äôd recommend everyone avoid the PABT area at all costs because it‚Äôs a complete shithole now and the cops won‚Äôt do anything to help you if you‚Äôre assaulted.

She discovered she was pregnant while being treated for stab wounds at the hospital, court documents said.\nThe Riviera Motel in Kissimmee, Fla.\nThe Riviera Motel in Kissimmee, Fla.Google Maps\nDec. 26, 2024, 1:15 PM EST\nBy Doha Madani\nA delivery driver allegedly returned to a Florida motel where a couple was staying and stabbed a woman multiple times this week over being tipped $2 on an order, police said.\n\nBrianna Alvelo, 22, is charged with attempted murder, home invasion with a firearm, kidnapping and aggravated assault, according to court records. A man who allegedly accompanied Alvelo during the incident has not yet been identified.\n\nA woman, her boyfriend, and the woman's 5-year-old daughter were staying at a Kissimmee motel to celebrate a birthday and ordered a Marco's pizza on Sunday, according to an affidavit filed in Alvelo's case. The affidavit is based on the woman's interview with the Osceola County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAlvelo delivered the pizza, which cost about $33, and was asked to give change for a $50 bill, the affidavit said. But Alvelo did not have change and the woman searched for smaller bills, allegedly only giving Alvelo a $2 tip in the end.\n\nSometime later, the woman said she heard a loud knocking on the door, the affidavit said. A man and woman clad in all black wearing face masks allegedly forced themselves into the room when she opened the door.\n\nThe man brandished a silver revolver and demanded the woman's boyfriend go into the bathroom, the affidavit said. And the other person, believed to be Alvelo, allegedly pulled out a pocket knife.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Alvelo rummaged through the woman's purse and broke her daughter's Nintendo Switch. The woman said she turned to shield her child and felt a strike to her lower back.\n\nShe then \"threw her daughter onto the bed and attempted to pick up her phone,\" the affidavit said.\n\nBut Alvelo allegedly grabbed the phone, smashed it, and \"began striking her multiple times with the knife.\" The man who had the gun then yelled it was time to go, stopping the assault, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe woman was stabbed 14 times, with wounds to the chest, arms, legs, and abdomen. She discovered she was pregnant while receiving treatment at a local hospital, the affidavit said.\n\nAlvelo is being held at the Osceola County Jail on a $55,000 bail and does not have an attorney listed for her.\n\nNBC South Florida reported that prosectors requested she be held without bond during her appearance in court, stating that this is a \"punishable by life offense.\"\n\nInvestigators reviewed motel security camera footage that showed a woman parking a red Toyota at around 10 p.m. and approaching the couple's motel room. The interaction appeared consistent with the woman's account of the delivery incident, the affidavit said.\n\nSecurity footage then shows a red Toyota back in the parking lot and two people with face masks returning to the couple's room roughly an hour and a half later, the affidavit said.\n\nA manager at the Marco's Pizza location confirmed to investigators that Alvelo was working the night of the incident, as well as the fact that she drives a red Toyota Camry. He also gave police a copy of her timecard, verifying that she finished her shift at 10:20 p.m. that night.\n\nThe Osceola County Sheriff's Office is asking that anyone with information on the incident contact the Crimeline at (800) 423-8477. I was a pizza delivery driver for 7 years and I got $0 for HUGE orders more than I care to remember. Never stabbed anyone. Can we say this was really about the tip and not an opportunity to rob a family staying a motel and thinking they could get away with it? No contact delivery onlyyyyyy This ain‚Äôt over the tip.  She came back to rob them. Life thrown away over less than 10 dollars. How can people genuinely be this stupid? I don't even bother with delivered food anymore. It never shows up hot. It's way too expensive after the delivery fee and tip. I genuinely don't trust people or the vehicles they drive to be clean enough to handle food. Too many horror stories of people's food messed with. \n\nIt's just not worth it. I will gladly drive 5-10 minutes to get my own food. An accomplice? Face masks? A knife and a gun? Sounds like they planned to commit a robbery. Premeditated attempted murder. Bail should be off the table for this psycho. Important: \n\nThe pregnant woman **survived**. It doesn't seem immediately obvious from the title. \n\nAlso, the tip wasn't mentioned by the attempted murderer, so it was most likely a robbery attempt gone wrong.",

You will do as you told, your entire life will be about your shitty job, and if anything comes up like a legit medical emergency or a hurricane and you‚Äôre told to evacuate, you will pay the price for ignoring orders from your asshole boss.

This man was happy just to be able to provide for his family, and that's what matters, not the fact that he delivered pizza to do so.  He used to deliver pizza to my family all of the time, he was the local delivery guy that we would usually get.  Nothing but smiles and polite greetings.  He would always ask how my little sister was doing because she came running to the door when I was paying for the pizza screaming because she had just seen a scary part of the movie.  It's weird how you remember things like that from such a horrible tragedy. RIP friend Ugh. I personally know a guy who works as a pizza delivery driver who barely survived a mugging like this. His story is heart breaking, too. \n\nHe's in his late 50s, lost his longtime job, so he took up pizza delivery. His wife was diagnosed with cancer. She's been in and out of hospitals for over four years. Each and every time they think that \"this is it.\"  But she somehow manages to recover (albeit, somewhat). Her insurance dropped her at some point, so they drained whatever savings they had into her medical expenses. \n\nLast year, he was shot during a robbery while on the job. His car was stolen, as was the $50 cash on his person. He survived, but was utterly broken. I remember him breaking down into tears as he recalled the night during a group outing. \n\nI don't believe they ever found the scumbag who did this. I sincerely hope Karma is a real thing, so that he and anyone else cold enough to commit such a senseless atrocity get the cold justice they truly deserve.  It's such a shame that such a dangerous job offers such shit pay. Cab drivers, too. I guess any job where you have to interact with strangers in sketchy neighborhoods at night.\n\nA few years ago in my city there was a rash of delivery drivers getting mugged and assaulted at gunpoint. They did the same thing in this article; ordered delivery to a vacant house. They replaced a delivery driver with an undercover cop and caught the assholes. I knew this guy from working at a gas station in the area. He was nice as hell and would drop off rejected pizzas or prank orders to people working in the area. One of the friendliest guys I've met. A very similar thing happened to my friend's father back in 2007. 54 year old father of three shot and killed by two teenagers who had called in fake Pizza Hut delivery order with the intent to rob him. It was his last delivery of the night and he was only a few streets away from his home. Just a father working three jobs trying to pay for his kids' college tuitions. \n\nhttp://www.postandcourier.com/article/20070815/PC1602/308159955\n\nThe tigger man (17 at the time) received 40 years. \n\nIt was the summer of my friend's freshman year of college. No one should have to go through something like that.  Poor guy. Delivery drivers, watch your backs. It's a hard world and there's always somebody looking to screw you over. \n\nMy rules for delivering safely:\n\n1.) Always be polite, it costs you nothing and could be worth as much as your life. \n\n2.) Carry ONLY your cell phone, car keys, insurance card, drivers liscense flashlight and bank ( no more than $25.00) \n\n3.) Know where you are going. If you don't know, ASK somebody. Call the client. \n\n4.) If you get a bad vibe, be more cautious. We go to some shady places and we're almost always alone. Park as close as possible, know how to get out quickly, and take a look around before you get out of the car. \n\n5.) If somebody robs you, let them. It's not always effective, but you are NOT carrying anything worth dying for. \n\n6.) Drop your cash every damn run. \n\n7.) Stay sober. Get high when you get off work.",

    "chunk_text": "43K fewer drivers on Manhattan roads after congestion pricing turned on, MTA says  I work in NJ and have seen the endless stream of private SUV‚Äôs pouring into the tunnel at every hour, every day of the week, almost all with a single occupant. \n\nMaybe some of those folks decided to take the train or maybe they decided to stay home, but NY & NJ sure won‚Äôt miss those 43k extra cars that didn‚Äôt have to be driving there. Won‚Äôt anyone think of the struggling businesses that are suddenly failing due to congestion pricing and not the fact that January is always the worst retail month of the year All I can say as an anecdote, going from Staten Island into Brooklyn into Manhattan daily for the past 5 years, this is the first time I‚Äôve seen a consistent drop off in traffic. Is it still too early to tell for certain? Probably. But before congestion pricing kicked in, traffic was abysmal as per usual from and to SI. Now it‚Äôs manageable. I‚Äôll take this small win. As far as I can tell, there is NO INCREASE IN BUS SERVICE YET! I think it‚Äôs hilarious that this great success came with a last minute zag by the governor arbitrarily cutting the price in half. Really screams data-driven decision making.\n\nListen, if congestion pricing works, great.¬†\nBut I‚Äôm really curious *who* isn‚Äôt driving in and what the tradeoffs are.¬†\n¬†\nWe know >50% of traffic in manhattan were taxis and rideshares, who are only nominally tolled.¬† These are the facts folks - congestion pricing is working and Manhattan saw 43K fewer drivers last week compared to the same week last year.\n\nJust remember this the next time someone says you're \"deeply anti-social\" for saying this is already working - data doesn't lie. edit: apparently it's common knowledge that CP refers to something else. I was just using it as an abbreviation for congestion pricing, which is the topic of this thread. Apologies. I will edit the comment\n\nWatch me get downvoted lmao\n\nPeople made posts asking if anyone noticed traffic differences, and all the congestion pricing supporters chimed in immediately saying it‚Äôs only been a few days and to wait for data\n\nWe get 1 week of data, which, in the big picture, isn‚Äôt much more significant than when all those above mentioned posts were made, and now all the congestion pricing supporters are chiming in saying it‚Äôs working. You‚Äôre all just looking for validation. \n\nThe month isn‚Äôt even half way through and yet the article says the MTA is comparing it to previous January years. How can you compare and report when this month isn‚Äôt even over yet. \n\nOn top of that, how are they even coming up with 43k fewer drivers? You can record the number of drivers entering from the tunnels, but otherwise how are they counting drivers coming from the other sources? Is there a camera counting drivers coming from the 59th st bridge? Williamsburg bridge? Etc? Were those cameras there before congestion pricing?\n\nThis part is just a guess, but I feel like congestion pricing would be most effective at the beginning. My thought is that most people want to avoid paying as long as they can. Eventually some people will just say screw it and pay. If I‚Äôm right, then I personally didn‚Äôt feel any speed difference on my bus route in the city. Rode the M15. If I‚Äôm wrong, then I still stand by my experience - bus didn‚Äôt travel any faster with congestion pricing. I‚Äôve read some other bus experiences saying they didn‚Äôt feel a speed difference either. Hopefully over time it will get better. However, what I truly hope gets better is ambulance and NYPD/FDNY response times. Would love to see that data. Oh wait. It‚Äôs only been a week. It‚Äôs only been a week",

It was a fun experience getting acquainted with the fans in line, got free pizza from Heidi Gardner and the weather was perfect for waiting in the street. Got our tickets at midnight and headed back to NBC the next night. It was intense and anxious hoping to find out that if we could get inside. Fifteen minutes before the 8:00, My mom and I got inside successfully in a close call. It was a real dream come true for me!! \n Omg very nice!  How did you get that gold card in pic 11? Easily one of the best episodes of the last 15 years. Glad you got to see it all happen in person. so what time did you get there on Friday? was never sure how this worked exactly. On first glance, I thought you'd make for a good Simon Pegg body double. Awesome!\n\nWas the monologue with the marching band the same at rehearsal? Did Elton and Brandi play? Any major differences from the live show? That would‚Äôve been an amazing show to see live! Damn! On my bucket list.

If that's the reason, pretty cool of him to do that. Aidy had one more season left in her because she gelled with the newer writers but happy to see her leaving on her own terms and on a high note And it begins! I'm surprised Cecily isn't in there. Wasn't she last to announce last season? Jost and Che seem probable as well. Kenan will probably get to stay until his 20th season. Absolute end of an era, even if expected. Not a surprise on most of these, Kate and Aidy both seemed ready for bigger things a while ago and with Beck this year Kyle felt a bit off\n\nPete is probably just for the best TBH he‚Äôs been MIA most of the season Kyle has produced some of my all time favorite SNL stuff and Kate at her best is an all time sketch performer. But my goodness is next season going to be a little less magical without Lil Baby Aidy ;( Who is gonna sing songs with Bowen next season without Aidy? Hopefully, no new cast members will be added to take their places. Even if those three leave, it‚Äôll still be too big.",
