    "chunk_text": "Getting saucy! Connecticut tourism bureau buys billboards in New York City to declare its pizza the best  I low key like the trolling.  Sally’s is fucking good. But they have like 3 places with top notch pizza. We have like 50…. I feel like if it were true you wouldn’t need a billboard to tell people. The CT tourism board is trying to attract tourists from NYC by offending them? I grew up in CT.  Sorry CT, the pizza there is mid at best. Just look at the sign and do a shaking your head chuckle, and move on, as it should be. “come to our state’s one elite spot, 4 really good places, and a rotating trendy one- conveniently, all in the same city!” Connecticut thinks a calzone is an italian sportscar.\n\nNobody goes out of their way to go to CT for a pizza unless you are stuck in traffic on 95. Pizza has a radius, the further away from NYC the shitter it gets there are a few exceptions to the rule but generally it is true truth A city that has a million pizza spots will inevitably have a bunch of really good ones. It will also have a lot of really shitty ones. Some of the best pizza I’ve had has been in NY. I’ve also had some of the worst in NY. Some of the best pizza I’ve had has also been outside of NY I think there is mutual respect between NY and New Haven when it comes to pizza. Chicago can fuck off with it's deep dish.",

Hopefully Dominoes is next. It's been a long time coming.  I love spotting the new restaurants in the old pizza huts painted weird colors. Apparently everyone out pizza'd the Hut... I dont know why the hut refuses to embrace delivery in NY and keeps pushing these restaurants...I worked in a restaurant when i was 17 and im now 35.  In NY where many areas have 10 non chain pizza spots in the area that all deliver you expect people to dine in?  You arent applebees.  Deliver that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts a shame cuz I really do think their za is the best out of all the corporate places.  Only thing even close was some papa johns I had in virginia but that was many moons ago. I favor the individual pizza shops over chain locations for all the obvious reasons, although I gotta say sometimes that lunch buffet Pizza Hut offered was perfect. I used to deliver fresh fruits and vegetables once a week when I lived in North Carolina, and my last stop was near a Pizza Hut. After lugging boxes in and out of my car for 4 hours I’d often stop in and do the buffet. For like $12 you got all you can eat pizza and pasta as well as a drink. Deep dish, pan, thin crust.. it was all there. Definitely not the best pizza, but not bad either. For $12 it was perfect. I hope they open some cool restaurants in place.  Like Thai Mii Up. Good!  I have had Pizza Hut 3 times in 2 states in the last 15 years. Every single time I got food poisoning.  \n\nFirst one was one near me in CT, food poisoning. Next one was 7 years later, at a different location in CT, food poisoning. And the final time, was on Long Island two years ago. Again food poisoning. \n\nPizza Hut sucks. If you want chain store pizza dominos has gotten immensely better, but I say stop being cheap and get one from a mom and pop shop where pizza is a million times better. \n\nRant over, sorry TIL this sub was a thing",

No wonder shit is as overpriced as it is in NYC. i miss the rent is too damn high person Commercial rent is so inflated, it's laughable. Just let the commercial real estate bubble collapse 25k a month. At 88 and 3 when half the buildings were vacant before Corona. These Corp real estate need to lose money NYC rent is insane! I worked at a similar spot that was 20k a month and also in 200k debt pre corona. But the owner is Teflon so it's still open somehow. If we wait 3 years and the read the balance sheet on this building, we will find that the landlord will have received less rent on this space, then he would have if he forgave the 198k and let them stay for 20k a month. I fully expect to see a year or two of vacancy, before they settle for 15k a month. Louisa is going to see Little of that $200k. My question is, do the landlords expect to get this money? Do they really think the pizza place has it and wouldn’t just declare bankruptcy? Not only that, if they pushed the pizza place out, do they really expect to get someone else in that spot soon?\n\nI used to work for a company that did office spaces and we never had someone ready to take over when we had a client who couldn’t pay anymore. Admittedly I don’t know what the retail/restaurant real estate market looks like but it seems wild to me. If the govt will forgive the landlord’s property tax, then he should forgive the tenants rent.

You could walk along it in an hour. But still, it was - it was a paradise for us. One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait, and the rats would come for the coconut, and...they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you've trapped all the rats. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it. And they begin to get hungry, and one by one... they will start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees. But now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now they only eat rat. Keeping the subways clean!

Same can be applied to bagels The red area should be NYC and North Jersey. Everywhere else is just ok.  Pizza in Connecticut is really good, particularly New Haven.  It's safe to say the average ny pie is better than the average in most states.  But that's about all you can say these days. The best pizza in any state is better than the average pizza in ny.  There needs to be a pocket of red in the Philadelphia area. Plenty of Italians in Philly making A-grade pizza equal to New York. /r/circlejerknyc Yay we have kind of okay pizza! Bronx pizza has always been my favorite! Pugsleys and Giovannis if interested.",

He’s in the icu but gonna be ok thankfully. Alot of people with mental health issues and drug problems around that area . Not surprised Can't even get a dollar slice without getting stabbed. Poor guy. November 21, 2020\n\n* **A man has been stabbed to death outside 2 Bros. Pizza at Eight Ave and West 38th Street in Midtown Manhattan**\n* **It's unlcear what led to the attack and cops are hunting for the suspect** \n* **The victim, who is believed to have been in his 40s, was taken to Bellevue Hospital and declared dead at 9.40pm** \n\nA man has been stabbed to death in Midtown Manhattan. \n\nThe incident happened around 9.15pm outside 2 Bros. Pizza at Eight Ave and West 38th Street. \n\nIt's unclear what led to the attack and cops are hunting for the suspect. \n\nEdgar Pol, who works at nearby Wok Stop told the [**New York Daily News**](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-man-stabbed-midtown-manhattan-20201122-cfzymlfw55gihcdbmjw3ath7zu-story.html): 'People just started yelling out of nowhere and people kept circling around this guy.\n\n'I saw the guy on the ground. Paramedics showed up and started giving him CPR.'\n\nThe victim, who is believed to have been in his 40s, was taken to Bellevue Hospital and declared dead at 9.40pm. \n\nThere has been an uptick in crime in the city amid the pandemic. \n\nAccording to [**NYPD statistics**](https://compstat.nypdonline.org/2e5c3f4b-85c1-4635-83c6-22b27fe7c75c/view/90) as of Saturday there has been 405 murders so far this year compared to 295 for the same period in 2019. That's an increase of 37.3 per cent.\n\nThe number of shooting victims and shooting incidents has also increased dramatically. \n\nSo far this year there have been 1,667 victims. That's compared to 828 for the same period last year - a rise of 101.3 per cent.\n\nAnd the number of shooting incidents has risen by 94.7 per cent from 698 for 2019 to 1,359 so far this year.  My work moved to this area pre-COVID and it’s staggering how bad it is. Obviously had been here before but being here every day I saw a lot of shit. \n\nHomeless / mentally ill screaming at people, some dude charged me on the sidewalk across from Macy’s for no reason, and then all the people just staggering around doing a zombie walk. Crazy this all happens within a block of the precinct on 30th street and they do... nothing. I lived in this area for 2 years before the pandemic... it used to be pretty sketchy at night but as a whole has REALLY declined since March. Nowadays there are massive camps of druggies taking over the street with mountains of their belongings... people openly shooting up and tweaking out in public.\n\nWorst thing is that there is a lot of mentally unstable scum screaming at strangers and threatening people on the streets. Nowadays it’s not uncommon to have a random crackhead yell at you or spit at you in that area. I’d recommend everyone avoid the PABT area at all costs because it’s a complete shithole now and the cops won’t do anything to help you if you’re assaulted. Probably some homeless dude with mental issues. Me and a bud got chased by some crazy guy with a knife yelling “I’m gonna kill you!” Chased us for a few good blocks till we hid in a 7-11. This was my best friend.....I hope they fucking catch this scumbag and he gets life and rots in prison..anyone know the slightest detail please help them catch this fucker I know I am an awful person for suggesting this but maybe we shouldn’t let violent psycho homeless people meander around the street aimlessly then.",

There’s a partially abandoned (undriveable but the owner uses it to store junk, never moves it) car in my neighborhood. Why won’t the city do anything about that? Mama Too's owner reported them apparently. This rule is so stupid. as if anyone is going to put back their sheds in the summer time. its impractical to have temporary sheds -- they are way to expensive. It doesn't make any sense for the city to mandate these sheds come down. The sheds can serve 30+ people a time. The parking spaces they took up serves only 2-4 NYers at a time.

She discovered she was pregnant while being treated for stab wounds at the hospital, court documents said.\nThe Riviera Motel in Kissimmee, Fla.\nThe Riviera Motel in Kissimmee, Fla.Google Maps\nDec. 26, 2024, 1:15 PM EST\nBy Doha Madani\nA delivery driver allegedly returned to a Florida motel where a couple was staying and stabbed a woman multiple times this week over being tipped $2 on an order, police said.\n\nBrianna Alvelo, 22, is charged with attempted murder, home invasion with a firearm, kidnapping and aggravated assault, according to court records. A man who allegedly accompanied Alvelo during the incident has not yet been identified.\n\nA woman, her boyfriend, and the woman's 5-year-old daughter were staying at a Kissimmee motel to celebrate a birthday and ordered a Marco's pizza on Sunday, according to an affidavit filed in Alvelo's case. The affidavit is based on the woman's interview with the Osceola County Sheriff's Office.\n\nAlvelo delivered the pizza, which cost about $33, and was asked to give change for a $50 bill, the affidavit said. But Alvelo did not have change and the woman searched for smaller bills, allegedly only giving Alvelo a $2 tip in the end.\n\nSometime later, the woman said she heard a loud knocking on the door, the affidavit said. A man and woman clad in all black wearing face masks allegedly forced themselves into the room when she opened the door.\n\nThe man brandished a silver revolver and demanded the woman's boyfriend go into the bathroom, the affidavit said. And the other person, believed to be Alvelo, allegedly pulled out a pocket knife.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Alvelo rummaged through the woman's purse and broke her daughter's Nintendo Switch. The woman said she turned to shield her child and felt a strike to her lower back.\n\nShe then \"threw her daughter onto the bed and attempted to pick up her phone,\" the affidavit said.\n\nBut Alvelo allegedly grabbed the phone, smashed it, and \"began striking her multiple times with the knife.\" The man who had the gun then yelled it was time to go, stopping the assault, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe woman was stabbed 14 times, with wounds to the chest, arms, legs, and abdomen. She discovered she was pregnant while receiving treatment at a local hospital, the affidavit said.\n\nAlvelo is being held at the Osceola County Jail on a $55,000 bail and does not have an attorney listed for her.\n\nNBC South Florida reported that prosectors requested she be held without bond during her appearance in court, stating that this is a \"punishable by life offense.\"\n\nInvestigators reviewed motel security camera footage that showed a woman parking a red Toyota at around 10 p.m. and approaching the couple's motel room. The interaction appeared consistent with the woman's account of the delivery incident, the affidavit said.\n\nSecurity footage then shows a red Toyota back in the parking lot and two people with face masks returning to the couple's room roughly an hour and a half later, the affidavit said.\n\nA manager at the Marco's Pizza location confirmed to investigators that Alvelo was working the night of the incident, as well as the fact that she drives a red Toyota Camry. He also gave police a copy of her timecard, verifying that she finished her shift at 10:20 p.m. that night.\n\nThe Osceola County Sheriff's Office is asking that anyone with information on the incident contact the Crimeline at (800) 423-8477. I was a pizza delivery driver for 7 years and I got $0 for HUGE orders more than I care to remember. Never stabbed anyone. Can we say this was really about the tip and not an opportunity to rob a family staying a motel and thinking they could get away with it? No contact delivery onlyyyyyy This ain’t over the tip.  She came back to rob them. Life thrown away over less than 10 dollars. How can people genuinely be this stupid? I don't even bother with delivered food anymore. It never shows up hot. It's way too expensive after the delivery fee and tip. I genuinely don't trust people or the vehicles they drive to be clean enough to handle food. Too many horror stories of people's food messed with. \n\nIt's just not worth it. I will gladly drive 5-10 minutes to get my own food. An accomplice? Face masks? A knife and a gun? Sounds like they planned to commit a robbery. Premeditated attempted murder. Bail should be off the table for this psycho. Important: \n\nThe pregnant woman **survived**. It doesn't seem immediately obvious from the title. \n\nAlso, the tip wasn't mentioned by the attempted murderer, so it was most likely a robbery attempt gone wrong.",

Then the next day, the lawsuit alleges deputies returned to the property to retrieve cell phones, radios and other items that had been left behind. The lawsuit also says 75 pizza boxes were “haphazardly discarded” on the property.\n\nSomeone planned a pot farm raid office holiday party. >But McCormick’s chief complaint is that he says the raid was conducted illegally. He says he worked with the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians a few months before the raid to secure license and lease agreements, as well as permits, to grow and sell cannabis on tribal land. His lawsuit alleges that tribal officials showed up during the raid, but were told by deputies that they needed to leave and would be arrested if they interfered.\n\nCops on the wrong side of the law? No way... I’m pretty sure unless those were federal BIA agents, going on tribal land is forbidden by state law enforcement. Sounds like they’ll probably get paid. Did they smoke the weed and get the munchies? None of this makes sense. Cops order a shit ton of pizza to “celebrate” the raid and also leave their belongings behind including cell phones. They also had his water shut off permanently? So he couldn’t extinguish a fire a month later at his home which then burnt down. Drug test them. 100% chance they all pop hot for cocaine and steroid use, and cannabis. They came back the next day to get phones and stuff, huh? Sounds like they had a big party with this guy’s weed. Where there is weed, pizza follows. Is that a pizza party to improve employee morale? > McCormick claims that more than 100 deputies and support staff conducted a predawn raid on his farm\n\n75 boxes for 100ish people?

Frankly eight years isn't a harsh enough sentence. Labor trafficking is so difficult to prove and prosecute and needs to be taken more seriously. > Papantoniadis violently choked a worker who expressed his intention to quit, causing the victim to flee in fear, investigators found. When a different employee attempted to leave, Papantoniadis chased him down Route 1 in Norwood, Massachusetts, and falsely reported him to the police in a bid to intimidate him into returning to work.  \n\nJesus Christ, that’s some Darth Vader-level shit. And they didn’t even mention some of his other crimes, like literally threatening to kill a worker, systemically falsifying paycheck information and time sheets to steal wages for years (and continuing even after getting investigated by the Labor Dept), and using Brush Script MT font in his signage. ^/s I used to eat at this dump until I found out he was already being investigated for this shit. That's it? At least it's something to make an example out of him Just a heads up. For whatever reason there are actually a bunch pizza places named Stash's in the Boston area that NOT OWNED by that POS so before you trash a business make sure it's the one he owns. This is the immigration issue no one talks about. So many of these \"i'm so concerned about the border/illegal immigrants\" people never say shit when you ask them what should be done to the people HIRING illegal immigrants. I’m honestly more shocked that a shitty employer is facing real consequences for a change and not just some nominal “cost of doing business” fine. I sincerely hope that anyone who is outraged by this, is also outraged by the demonization of immigrants from some quarters of society. >In June, he was convicted on three counts of forced labor and three counts of attempted forced labor.\n\nWonder why only half were forced, and half were attempted",

Great thinking by the victim and kudos to the 911 operator! There is a pretty famous recording of a lady doing this a few years ago in a DV situation.

Also at 11: Water still wet; sky blue. \n\nSeriously though, glad things worked out for this woman. \n\nOn a semi-related note, if you ever call 911 by accident, don't just hang up, say \"Sorry, wrong number.\" Otherwise, they may send someone out to investigate and make sure the caller wasn't somehow incapacitated or unable to speak, and they probably won't be very pleased with you if you aren't in need of emergency services.  Man that guys a fucking dumbass.

Way too many planes, facilities, training processes.. way too few military controllers. Also, it takes many months (12+)to be qualified anyways as an ATC. Most military controllers have gone to the FAA anyways. Just to work w/o pay..\n\nAint. Gonna. Happen. \n\nSource: Active duty USAF ATC.. 7 years in. I’ve seen the manning documents.

This is sadly the case for low or minimum wage workers all the time. You will do as you told, your entire life will be about your shitty job, and if anything comes up like a legit medical emergency or a hurricane and you’re told to evacuate, you will pay the price for ignoring orders from your asshole boss.  My manager gave me the same bullshit. He said, and I quote, \"get your ass in here! We're in Fucking Oregon!\" I live in a beach town on the east coast. When hurricane Sandy was on its way up, I was working for Target, and informed my manager that I lived on a flood-prone street, and therefore would be leaving my car in a nearby University's parking garage.

His story is heart breaking, too. \n\nHe's in his late 50s, lost his longtime job, so he took up pizza delivery. His wife was diagnosed with cancer. She's been in and out of hospitals for over four years. Each and every time they think that \"this is it.\"  But she somehow manages to recover (albeit, somewhat). Her insurance dropped her at some point, so they drained whatever savings they had into her medical expenses. \n\nLast year, he was shot during a robbery while on the job. His car was stolen, as was the $50 cash on his person. He survived, but was utterly broken. I remember him breaking down into tears as he recalled the night during a group outing. \n\nI don't believe they ever found the scumbag who did this. I sincerely hope Karma is a real thing, so that he and anyone else cold enough to commit such a senseless atrocity get the cold justice they truly deserve.  It's such a shame that such a dangerous job offers such shit pay. Cab drivers, too. I guess any job where you have to interact with strangers in sketchy neighborhoods at night.\n\nA few years ago in my city there was a rash of delivery drivers getting mugged and assaulted at gunpoint. They did the same thing in this article; ordered delivery to a vacant house. They replaced a delivery driver with an undercover cop and caught the assholes. I knew this guy from working at a gas station in the area. He was nice as hell and would drop off rejected pizzas or prank orders to people working in the area. One of the friendliest guys I've met. A very similar thing happened to my friend's father back in 2007. 54 year old father of three shot and killed by two teenagers who had called in fake Pizza Hut delivery order with the intent to rob him. It was his last delivery of the night and he was only a few streets away from his home. Just a father working three jobs trying to pay for his kids' college tuitions. \n\nhttp://www.postandcourier.com/article/20070815/PC1602/308159955\n\nThe tigger man (17 at the time) received 40 years. \n\nIt was the summer of my friend's freshman year of college. No one should have to go through something like that.  Poor guy. Delivery drivers, watch your backs. It's a hard world and there's always somebody looking to screw you over. \n\nMy rules for delivering safely:\n\n1.) Always be polite, it costs you nothing and could be worth as much as your life. \n\n2.) Carry ONLY your cell phone, car keys, insurance card, drivers liscense flashlight and bank ( no more than $25.00) \n\n3.) Know where you are going. If you don't know, ASK somebody. Call the client. \n\n4.) If you get a bad vibe, be more cautious. We go to some shady places and we're almost always alone. Park as close as possible, know how to get out quickly, and take a look around before you get out of the car. \n\n5.) If somebody robs you, let them. It's not always effective, but you are NOT carrying anything worth dying for. \n\n6.) Drop your cash every damn run. \n\n7.) Stay sober. Get high when you get off work.",

That article is from February but I believe they are still there now. This is a full year after they started guarding it from the protests. Once they find an excuse to plant an overtime racking van or cruiser, there's no end in sight. And just look at the level of bootlicking bullshit conservatives will use to defend it:\n\n>Meanwhile, Republican City Councilmember Joe Borelli of Staten Island told THE CITY that he believes the monuments need to remain under police watch.  \n>  \n>“Protecting public monuments and art is part of the NYPD’s mission,” Borelli said. “As long as there are psychotic leftists who want to make amends for a 400-year-old historical squabble by destroying a monument, then we have to protect them.”",

Just like any other buffet, they’re going to skimp on quality, shop amenities, and give you “decent” food, surely not all you can eat in most cases. Cici’s pizza used to be in the city a decade ago (in the Bronx) but they’re no longer here, given it’s an expensive place to do business, and don’t think there’s any pizza buffets left in the city.\n\nDollar slices (well 1,50$ slices nowadays) are still here & the taste is tolerable if people don’t want gourmet 4-5$ pizza slices like L’Industrie or Fini. Also yeah, our area has great pizza. IDK, looks like it would still taste good. Kinda like dominos. Its not NYC pizza, but its still pizza and most pizza is delicious. There's plenty of pizza places in the city that look exactly like that.  It's not like every slice place is amazing.  Most are meh. I don't think I've heard a sentence so mundanely horrific as \"we're regulars at the pizza ranch buffet\" That pizza actually looks like it could be good- at least the cheese is well cooked Shut the fuck up unless you’ve been to a Pizza Ranch, that place slaps.\n\nIs it the best pizza in the world? Hell no. But don’t you fucking sit there and tell me that getting a slice of taco pizza followed by a slice of bbq pizza followed by a slice of Mac and Cheese pizza followed by a slice of buffalo chicken pizza followed by a slice of chicken francese pizza followed by a slice of dessert pizza followed by another slice of taco pizza followed by a final slice of dessert pizza followed by some garlic breadsticks for the road, all for $15 is not a good fucking time. Alright, but you gotta get over it. I’d go to town on that pizza. Love me some ny pizza but we don’t need to be snobbish about it Looks like a Fini slice and I see yuppies lining up for it.

    "chunk_text": "43K fewer drivers on Manhattan roads after congestion pricing turned on, MTA says  I work in NJ and have seen the endless stream of private SUV’s pouring into the tunnel at every hour, every day of the week, almost all with a single occupant. \n\nMaybe some of those folks decided to take the train or maybe they decided to stay home, but NY & NJ sure won’t miss those 43k extra cars that didn’t have to be driving there. Won’t anyone think of the struggling businesses that are suddenly failing due to congestion pricing and not the fact that January is always the worst retail month of the year All I can say as an anecdote, going from Staten Island into Brooklyn into Manhattan daily for the past 5 years, this is the first time I’ve seen a consistent drop off in traffic. Is it still too early to tell for certain? Probably. But before congestion pricing kicked in, traffic was abysmal as per usual from and to SI. Now it’s manageable. I’ll take this small win. As far as I can tell, there is NO INCREASE IN BUS SERVICE YET! I think it’s hilarious that this great success came with a last minute zag by the governor arbitrarily cutting the price in half. Really screams data-driven decision making.\n\nListen, if congestion pricing works, great. \nBut I’m really curious *who* isn’t driving in and what the tradeoffs are. \n \nWe know >50% of traffic in manhattan were taxis and rideshares, who are only nominally tolled.  These are the facts folks - congestion pricing is working and Manhattan saw 43K fewer drivers last week compared to the same week last year.\n\nJust remember this the next time someone says you're \"deeply anti-social\" for saying this is already working - data doesn't lie. edit: apparently it's common knowledge that CP refers to something else. I was just using it as an abbreviation for congestion pricing, which is the topic of this thread. Apologies. I will edit the comment\n\nWatch me get downvoted lmao\n\nPeople made posts asking if anyone noticed traffic differences, and all the congestion pricing supporters chimed in immediately saying it’s only been a few days and to wait for data\n\nWe get 1 week of data, which, in the big picture, isn’t much more significant than when all those above mentioned posts were made, and now all the congestion pricing supporters are chiming in saying it’s working. You’re all just looking for validation. \n\nThe month isn’t even half way through and yet the article says the MTA is comparing it to previous January years. How can you compare and report when this month isn’t even over yet. \n\nOn top of that, how are they even coming up with 43k fewer drivers? You can record the number of drivers entering from the tunnels, but otherwise how are they counting drivers coming from the other sources? Is there a camera counting drivers coming from the 59th st bridge? Williamsburg bridge? Etc? Were those cameras there before congestion pricing?\n\nThis part is just a guess, but I feel like congestion pricing would be most effective at the beginning. My thought is that most people want to avoid paying as long as they can. Eventually some people will just say screw it and pay. If I’m right, then I personally didn’t feel any speed difference on my bus route in the city. Rode the M15. If I’m wrong, then I still stand by my experience - bus didn’t travel any faster with congestion pricing. I’ve read some other bus experiences saying they didn’t feel a speed difference either. Hopefully over time it will get better. However, what I truly hope gets better is ambulance and NYPD/FDNY response times. Would love to see that data. Oh wait. It’s only been a week.

Miles McBride went to the chiropractor and they did something to unlock his spine. He’s actually 6’8” The return of ron baker, our new 6th man all star Knicks hire Johnnie Bryant.\n\nYou can’t make any trades yet so what else could it possibly be? Does this account routinely predict things correctly?  Or did they get lucky one time?  People post shit like this all the time. Sometimes some accounts will be right doesn’t mean they knew something.  The fact that the post is vague and could literally be validated by anything that came out about thibs. I dunno.  Just skeptical They did a twitter spaces. I listened, not sure if it was a waste of my time.\nWill post summary cause reddit might not hear about it.\n\nBasically a whole bunch of nothing aside from saying Jason Kidd is unhappy and might be a candidate at the level Bryant is. \n\n\nMore nothing, acting like they know something.\nAnd then saying twice and once again at the end Leon wants to go after a supermax superstar without giving up KAT. And finally at the end voicing that Brunson and Rick aren’t going anywhere.\n\n\nObviously the only guy is Giannis, and who knows even more impossible but jokic (just realistically the only other description fitter from their words & max contract that wouldn’t be a waste to trade for if you want to game theory outside Giannis). Not sure if it was a complete waste of my time, but that’s exactly what was said on the spaces. \"Knicks cloned Phil Jackson 35 years ago; tap clone for head coach\" They piggy backed off KFTV and hedged their bets. They reported they knew after the fact. Alex is a tool Tuned in late, but all I heard was:  \n  \nPlayer survey they know about was that only 2 were pro Thibs: Brunson and Hart. 7 players were OUT on Thibs, but they don't know if KAT was part of that group.\n\nMalone and Udoka are not candidates.\n\nMutual interest with JKidd.\n\nWorking on acquiring another superstar, while still keeping Brunson and KAT. \n\nIf anyone has more that I missed, or added details, please share! We’re trading for Giannis. Manifest it Did they correctly predict that Thibs would be fired or did they say “big things are coming” after Shams reported the Knicks were hoping to make a big splash this offseason?",

It was a fun experience getting acquainted with the fans in line, got free pizza from Heidi Gardner and the weather was perfect for waiting in the street. Got our tickets at midnight and headed back to NBC the next night. It was intense and anxious hoping to find out that if we could get inside. Fifteen minutes before the 8:00, My mom and I got inside successfully in a close call. It was a real dream come true for me!! \n Omg very nice!  How did you get that gold card in pic 11? Easily one of the best episodes of the last 15 years. Glad you got to see it all happen in person. so what time did you get there on Friday? was never sure how this worked exactly. On first glance, I thought you'd make for a good Simon Pegg body double. Awesome!\n\nWas the monologue with the marching band the same at rehearsal? Did Elton and Brandi play? Any major differences from the live show? That would’ve been an amazing show to see live! Damn! On my bucket list. Every time we goto NYC I wanna try the stand by line, but then I’m afraid I’ll be wasting a day if we don’t get in. So jealous. I’m Good sitting next to you in line! You lucked out with weather, this week wasn’t so great! Welp, I’m jealous. https://preview.redd.it/cu2560z8piue1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a85433c15b2be5790970fbd021241f26fcfbd8d",

This was an instant classic in my house Eat it, it’s getting cold! Pizza that's practically pizza in every way.. except for a few key ones. Do not taunt Almost Pizza It's funny because if you look at lots of frozen \"pepperoni\" pizza it's topped with \"pepperoni flavored pizza topping\". So it's like... Almost pepperoni. But WTF is it?! I don’t mean to be a Seth here but I always thought the sketch should not have Kristin being scared at the end. She was fully behind the Almost Pizza so shouldn’t she just be smiling at the end? from Pfizer!",

Several city blocks and bouncers working the front. Insane. ...after which you said, \"hey, this is stupid\", walked out of line and went somewhere else to buy a slice of pizza like a goddamn adult?\n\nI mean, I can understand lining up for unique, one-of-a-kind experiences but wasting your precious time just to save a few bucks is dumb. \"Toronto is just like New York, but without all the stuff\" Tbh it was mid when I had it. The shakes were better than the food Oh this isn’t just for a slice. This is for a free whole large pizza which is like $30 how long did you have to wait? was it good? cue to all the comments that are\ncoming saying how much money you couldve made in the amount of time you were in line and how\nmany pizzas you couldve bought with that money! (not me, lol, i love free shit lollol) About an hour and a half. I’m still in line but I’m almost at the front of the spot Luckily I have work after this so I’m not losing anything",

If that's the reason, pretty cool of him to do that. Aidy had one more season left in her because she gelled with the newer writers but happy to see her leaving on her own terms and on a high note And it begins! I'm surprised Cecily isn't in there. Wasn't she last to announce last season? Jost and Che seem probable as well. Kenan will probably get to stay until his 20th season. Absolute end of an era, even if expected. Not a surprise on most of these, Kate and Aidy both seemed ready for bigger things a while ago and with Beck this year Kyle felt a bit off\n\nPete is probably just for the best TBH he’s been MIA most of the season Kyle has produced some of my all time favorite SNL stuff and Kate at her best is an all time sketch performer. But my goodness is next season going to be a little less magical without Lil Baby Aidy ;( Who is gonna sing songs with Bowen next season without Aidy? Hopefully, no new cast members will be added to take their places. Even if those three leave, it’ll still be too big.",

I did stand-by a couple years ago to the Phoebe Waller-Bridge/Taylor Swift show and Taylor sent pizza to everyone in line. Moments like that make these people seem so genuine. Joe’s! Great choice. What are they doing to that poor pizza?  Don't hold it sideways like that. Halsey's good people. Halsey's relationship with and love for SNL has gotten me into her music. \n\nThe painting she did while performing the song was one of the best musical segments I'd ever seen. I just find myself loving Halsey more and more. She’s great on SNL, released two back to back incredible records, and just all around seems awesome. I wish Halsey were hosting/performing 😥 Toppings? Halsey rocs! I’m pretty sure NBC/SNL pays for this and does this every show week for the standby line. Anyone know how long the line was/is?",

And it gets even awesomer… You take a hot dog, stuff it with some jack cheese, fold it in a pizza, you've got cheesy blasters! Everything but the corn husk. As an American I am extremely offended...that's nit enough cheese They should’ve started by adding something unnecessary to the meat.\n\nMy parents *love* raisins in taco meat. We live in LA. My stepmom works in East LA. And they still see absolutely no problem with putting raisins in spicy ground beef intended to be covered with onions and cilantro and salsa and whatnot.
