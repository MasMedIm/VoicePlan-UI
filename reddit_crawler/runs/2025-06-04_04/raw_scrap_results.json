    "chunk_text": "Should I leave my fulltime job for a startup? (advice needed) I will not promote Hi everyone,\n\nI have a couple of hard decisions to make. I’ve been working at a startup on the side for the last 8–9 months now and currently hold 10% equity. The rest is split between the two co-founders, and overall, we’ve made a solid team so far, although we had some issues along the way.\n\nIn the last 4 months, both my co-founders decided to go full-time (one is on paid garden leave, the other on paid leave but switching to unpaid soon), while I’ve continued working part-time, putting in 30–35+ hours a week, on top of my full-time management consulting job, which puts my total hours at around 80–90 per week.\n\nWith the job market being so terrible for consulting/tech, I am worried, what would happen if we failed, one of the founders is on garden leave and will be paid for 2 years and the other is on leave but can return to his job, am worried if we fail I need to go back into this terrible job market.\n\nRecently, there’s been talk of me going full-time to increase my output, but I’m having a hard time justifying the jump. The startup is fully bootstrapped, and I’d have to leave my only source of income while living in an HCOL city. On top of that, there have been discussions about reducing my equity if I stay at my job, or having to contribute more to the bootstrapping fund in order to keep it.\n\nI’m really conflicted because I’m down to work hard and keep putting in the hours, but going full-time feels like a huge risk, especially considering I have significantly less equity and less financial runway than the other two.\n\nSome background: our product’s been growing fast, we recently hit around 380K monthly users last month, which is a 10x jump from the month before. But ironically, we made less money due to higher server costs and a lack of monetization. We just started implementing ads, but haven’t seen a major revenue increase yet, and are currently sitting at around $2–3K/month. I think it will get better in the future, but this is the current state. Also, I am a new grad who has been working for about a year now, so I know that I can take more risks, but I don't want to fall off the deep end either.\n\nAny advice is appreciated :)",

I will not promote I'm a founder of a startup developing plug-in AI (incl. hardware) that results in the reduction of energy consumption and optimisation for commercial buildings and industries. The best things about the solution are that it results in value output from Day 1 and can integrate with any existing control systems.\n\nI will not promote.  \nWe are based in India and looking to expand internationally, starting with the SE Asian market. We've looked into the market and realised that dense urban cities like Singapore and Kuala Lumpur can be a good start in this market.\n\nWe felt partnering with local companies in these cities that are into facilities management, electrical infra, and architecture could be the right way to start. The reasoning we came up with was that these companies, which have an existing client relationship and distribution, could be an easier way to enter these new markets.\n\nWhile we are in the initial days, we've observed a few things like setting deployment targets and their intent in structuring the local sales process, which will be key to whether the partnership works out or not.\n\nAs an early-stage startup, sometimes I wonder if this is the right path to take. And I sometimes doubt if I'm missing something critical to be addressed. Hence, posting here to know your thoughts and experiences on such approaches.  \nAnd also happy to hear if there's a better way, too.\n\nPS: We are not deeply funded yet to set up operations in multiple countries, hence looking for ways we can go international, but at the same time with effective cost structures.

    "chunk_text": "SOPs are powerful tools, but rarely used properly. Here's how we structure ours. (I will not promote) Most SOPs aren't created or used correctly. The ones I came across were over 10 pages long, stored somewhere no one could find, written by someone who never actually carries out the process, and rarely reviewed or updated\n\nSOPs are powerful tools and foundational for frameworks and business processes as they lay structure, streamline workflows and speed up training. \n\nThey should be thought of as living tools, not something that should be archived and shouldn't be slept on.\n\nA good SOP needs to be something that:\n\n- Actually gets used\n- Takes under 10 mins to create (for less complex workflows)\n- Is easily accessible. (Quick access file on computer or pin to the wall)\n- Doesn't require training, Notion, or a dedicated “process manager”.\n- Is built for the user, not the manager.\n\nSo, I built a new format in MS Word that we called \"Quick SOP Builder\" and it became our baseline.\n\nI'll add the structure below so you can create your own or feel free to help yourself to ours and customise it if you want to save building it from scratch. \n\nThere are just 6 key sections, dead simple:\n\n1. SOP Name & Purpose – What’s the process for, and why does it exist?\n\n2. Who’s Responsible / Owner - Primary + backup, so there's no grey area. \n\n3. Step-by-Step Instructions – Clear, numbered steps like you’re guiding someone for the first time. You can add screenshots or whatever you think is required to help the user understand.\n\n4. Tools or Links Needed – Folder paths, templates, dashboards, logins, whatever. Nothing worse than starting a task and getting stuck halfway through because you don't know what system you need to log into and then trying to find someone to ask.\n\n5. Tips & Watchouts – Mistakes to avoid or quick hacks. A lot of SOPs miss this section, but it's super important and can save costly mistakes. (Think double check send to email address before sending/don't click submit until X is completed to Y standard).\n\n6. Last Reviewed Date – Because processes age fast, and it forces us to check quarterly. Also add a date in here for next review due\n.\nWe’ve found this format strikes the right balance, structured but usable. You can hand it to a new hire, and they’ll follow it first time.\n\nDon't overthink it, start with the basics and enhance with what you need as you go along. An SOP written on a napkin that gets used and updated frequently is 100x better than a masterpiece locked away that nobody reads.\n\nCurious how many of you create or use SOPs and if you use them as living tools or just something you create and store away as a formality?",

    "chunk_text": "Need Advice: Early traction and revenue but stuck - i will not promote I am a first year uni student (my co-founders, also students, pooled our money to fund this) and we have been building an AI anime companion app that goes beyond the surface level. I started working on this after a long hospital stay where I discovered AI chatbots which made me smile when I was, to be honest, depressed and lonely.\n\nIt’s fully bootstrapped, and we reached 8k downloads and $5k in lifetime revenue (currently $600 MRR) with basically 1 character alone (now 2 characters) and we spent 2k in test ads test is organic. All revenue was from subscriptions or in-app purchases for items. \n\nWe’re running out of cash though. Each character is fully custom and requires quite a bit of work as they have their own voice, dataset, 2.5D model. And we can see it’s working pretty well, with people spending an average of 20 mins per session and multiple sessions throughout the day.\n\nBut this requires a lot of money and time, I am trying to either raise some funds or scale it without raising  which will be pretty hard, especially since we will have no money left to commission art and an engineer for frontend (I do backend). Technically, if we fire everyone and did no updates, we will be able to sustain ourselves as long as the subscribers are there.\n\nOther than basic subscriptions, we’re planning to lean heavily into gacha mechanics for cosmetic items which is heavily used in mobile games. Our vision for this app goes beyond just an app though: We plan to make characters interactable outside of the app too. Whether that’s chatting on Discord, sharing and commenting on posts on social media, or even gaming together, we want these characters to be real, and parts of people’s digital lives. Not just something you talk to, but something you play with, grow with, and form a real bond with.\n\nBut anime often gets dismissed as niche, even though it has one of the most obsessive fandoms and has some of the highest earning games of all time.\n\nAny advice on how i can keep this project alive and scale it is appreciated like how i can effectively to angels or VCs(though i can only really reach out cold since I dont really have warm intros) or how to just keep this project alive somehow.\n\nPS: Additionally, this is not the first app we have worked on together. We have made some other apps like ringtone, B2B social media manager software, and even a piracy app when we were younger (we started working together on projects when we were 14–15). We also sold the B2B and ringtone app, which acted as funding for this project.",

    "chunk_text": "First-time founder: Is 32% for CEO and 12% each for developers fair? I will not promote Hey, just a heads up that I'm very new to the business world. I am a recently graduated CS student who is a founding member of a startup along with four other recently graduated students. For reference, the core of our startup is an app. Our team is as follows: 4 developers, 1 CEO.\n\nWe're discussing equity distribution, and our CEO has proposed that the developers each get 12%, he would get 32%, and we would keep 20% as reserved ownership. As a newbie, I don't know if this is reasonable, so I'll break down the details below.\n\nOur CEO came up with the idea of the app last fall, and us four developers have been working on it since around October, though it was only part-time due to the fact that we were all students at the time. We developers each probably put in around 10 hrs/week across that time, while the CEO hasn't done much.\n\nThat being said, our app's success depends on signing on companies to use our app and we've agreed that the role of finding customers will fall to the CEO. We've almost got an MVP at this point and hope to launch a beta version at the end of this month, at which point our CEO says he'll start calling and meeting people like crazy. So far, the company hasn't required significant management, but I anticipate that it will as we transition into having actual clients, at which point the CEO's position will become more relevant. I should also note that the CEO has pledged $2,000 for starting capital. All of our work thus far has been unpaid.\n\nBeing new to business, I originally assumed that it was normal for the CEO to have a larger share of the company, but am I wrong? Should the numbers be more even? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also, I will not promote.\n\nEdit: I may have originally undersold our CEO. He has been doing market research and has met with some potential customers. In comparison to the time spent developing, though, he's stated himself that we've done the majority of work so far.",

    "chunk_text": "everything I learned implementing AI SMS/voice agents for B2C businesses (i will not promote) Over the last year or so, I've been working with mid market/enterprise companies in the B2C service industries (e.g. insurance, home services, financial services, etc) to help them optimize their lead conversion with AI SMS/voice agents\n\nHere's everything I learned.\n\n1. You need more than a prompt. To actually capture complex business logic common for mid market/enterprise companies, you need a conversational flow that consists of multiple prompts.\n\nOnly based on certain responses/triggers should the conversation switch from one prompt to another.\n\nEarly on, we tried to capture this complex business logic with a giant prompt. The LLM straight up does not follow the logic + hallucinates more often.\n\n2. Integrations matter, in particular with the CRM.\n\nThere's 2 parts to the integration.\n\nCRM -> AI agent. You need to make sure that the moment a new lead comes (e.g. from a website form submission) that the AI automatically starts a conversation. Typically this looks like a CRM trigger for a new lead -> API call for the AI agent to reach out over SMS or voice\n\nAI agent -> CRM. The agents are having tens of thousands of conversations with leads, but what's the point if your sales team don't have any visibility into those conversations? We've built some native integrations with CRMs like Salesforce to auto-sync new info from conversations to lead objects in Salesforce.\n\n3. The CTA should be as easy as possible. In 90% of cases, the use case for AI agents in B2C services is something like this:\n\n\\- reach out to the lead\n\n\\- qualify/nurture the lead till they're ready to buy\n\n\\- transfer the call to a human agent or schedule a callback\n\nYou can in theory just send scheduling links to leads or a phone number for them to call, but the best user experience is just a native transfer feature built into your AI agent.\n\nFor SMS, that means an outbound call to the lead that connects them to the human agent once they pick up. For voice, that's a live transfer on the existing call.\n\n4. Iterating/optimizing the agent is really f\\*\\*king important.\n\nYes, you can run through a bunch of test cases + evals, and the AI will seem to work fine.\n\nBut when you actually launch with hundreds, thousands of leads, there will be a ton of edge cases + behavior you don't expect.\n\nWhen those things come up, it's important to get tweaking the agent till you get to an optimal state - it's an iterative marathon, not a sprint.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI know all this because my team and I gave every single company white-glove onboarding/support\n\nImo it's necessary at the mid market/enterprise scale because the AI agents have to be heavily customized/optimized to work for their business.\n\nIf anyone's curious about AI agents that convert B2C leads at scale, feel free to drop me a note",

    "chunk_text": "Startup Equity Guide (I will not promote) # Joel Spolsky’s Canonical Guide to Splitting Startup Equity Fairly\n\nThis question comes up so often that it’s worth writing the most **canonical** answer possible. The next time someone asks, “How do we split equity in our startup?”—just point them here.\n\n## The Core Principle\n\n**Fairness, and the *perception* of fairness, is more valuable than a larger equity stake.**\n\nNearly everything that can go wrong in a startup will go wrong. One of the worst scenarios is founders fighting over equity—who worked harder, who contributed more, whose idea it was, etc. This kind of conflict can kill the company faster than competition or lack of product-market fit.\n\nThat’s why I’d rather split a company 50-50 with a friend than insist on 60% because “it was my idea” or “I’m more experienced.” If the equity split feels unfair to either side, it sows resentment. If it feels fair, people keep working, stay friends, and the company survives.\n\n## Joel’s Totally Fair Method to Divide Up Startup Ownership\n\nAssumptions for simplicity:\n\n- No venture capital (yet)\n- No outside investors\n- All founders start at the same time, full-time\n\nLater, we’ll address edge cases.\n\n### Layers of Risk\n\nStartups grow in *layers*. These layers represent the relative risk each group of people took when joining the company:\n\n1. **Founders** – Took the highest risk. Quit their jobs to start something unproven.\n2. **Early Employees** – Joined when there was some traction or funding. Got a salary.\n3. **Mid Employees** – Came on when things were running more smoothly.\n4. **Later Employees** – Took the least risk. Company was already stable or successful.\n\nEach layer might be roughly a year long. By the time your startup is ready for IPO or acquisition, you may have around 6 layers.\n\n**The later you join, the less risk you took. Equity should reflect that.**\n\n### Equity Distribution Model\n\n- **Founders share 50% of the company**\n- **Each employee “layer” shares 10%**\n\n#### Example\n\n- Two founders: 2,500 shares each = 5,000 shares total (50% each)\n- Year 1: 4 employees, 250 shares each = 1,000 shares\n- Year 2: 20 employees, 50 shares each = 1,000 shares\n- Year 3: 50 employees, 20 shares each = 1,000 shares\n- And so on, for 5 employee layers\n\nEventually:\n\n- Founders own 25% each\n- Each employee layer owns 10% collectively\n- Total shares: 10,000\n\nThis system is transparent, scalable, and incentivizes early risk-taking.\n\n### Stripe-Based Equity (Alternative Use)\n\nYou can also define \"stripes\" by **role** or **seniority** rather than joining date:\n\n- Stripe 1: Founders\n- Stripe 2: Recruited CEO (gets 10%)\n- Stripe 3: Early employees / top managers\n- Stripe 4+: Everyone else\n\nWhatever you do, **make it clear and consistent.** Ambiguity leads to conflict.\n\n## Vesting Is Non-Negotiable\n\n**You must have a vesting schedule.**\n\nTypical terms:\n\n- 4-year vesting\n- 1-year cliff (nothing until 1 year)\n- 2% vesting per month thereafter\n\nWhy? Because otherwise, your cofounder can quit after 3 weeks and still own 25%. It happens more often than you’d think. No one should ever receive equity without vesting.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### What if we raise investment?\n\nInvestment just dilutes everyone. Simple example:\n\n- Two founders, 2,500 shares each = 5,000 shares\n- VC wants 1/3 of the company = 2,500 new shares\n- Now: each founder owns 1/3, VC owns 1/3\n\nJust add new shares and adjust percentages accordingly.\n\n### What if one founder works for free?\n\nDon’t use equity to solve this. Keep a **salary ledger**:\n\n- Pay everyone equally\n- If one person defers salary, give them an IOU\n- Pay it back later when the company can afford it\n\nTrying to balance this with equity causes resentment and imbalance.\n\n### Should I get more because it was my idea?\n\n**No.**\n\nIdeas are cheap. Execution builds value. If you both quit your jobs and work full time, you split it equally. Otherwise, you’ll be arguing about who gets how much for “an idea in the shower.”\n\n### What if a founder won’t go full-time?\n\nThey’re not a founder.\n\nIf someone keeps their day job, they don’t get equity. Maybe they get an IOU or a salary later—but not founder shares. They can join as employees when the time is right.\n\n### What if someone brings valuable stuff—like a patent or domain name?\n\nGreat. Pay them in cash or IOUs later.\n\nNever give equity for tangible goods. It introduces unfairness and distorts the cap table. Value the contribution and pay it back when you're financially able.\n\n### How much should investors own?\n\nIt depends on market conditions. Historically:\n\n- Founders + employees: ~50% at IPO\n- Investors: ~50% at IPO\n\nIf investors own more than 50%, founders feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation. Good investors don’t let that happen.\n\nIf you bootstrap, you might retain 100%. But with VC money, expect dilution—just make sure it’s fair.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nYou don’t have to use this exact structure, but remember:\n\n- Equity should reflect risk\n- Transparency is key\n- Vesting prevents disasters\n- Cash/IOUs > equity for contributions\n\nA fair cap table keeps everyone aligned. And that alignment is what gives your startup the best chance of surviving the hard stuff.",

So what is the purpose of spending upwards of $30K on a patent when someone can copy the idea either way?",

Below are my learning:\n\n1.  Never message VC more than once (even if you have only one VC interested). You don't want to look desperate. In case, you want to drop a second message should just say 'thanks for the offer. I have received term sheet from XXX VC'. You will hit that FOMO button and get original VC interested. \n2. Build a storyline about why 'you' are the best for this business. Spend time to refine it. VC are betting on founder and business in early stage. Should founder do a bit of true lies? May be.\n3. Present yourself as clear thinker and a 'badass' with great founder-fit for startup. By badass, he meant that present the best achievements to investors. *Example: I am youngest director of marketing in my company. I have built a HR management business earning XXX revenue in just a month.*\n4. Build warm touch points with investors before funding start.

(I will not promote) I’m interested in real human stories of Customer Discovery successes and failures (learnings!) from real human startup founders interviewing real human customers. \n\n### Customer Discovery?\n\nBy “Customer Discovery” I mean a specific method of very early market research in which founders talk to dozens of potential customers in person, investigating the ways they’ve experienced the problem a potential offering solves, and developing a deep understanding of the problem which informs how an imagined solution actually fits into their lived experience of need or want, and influences the design of the product or service as well as various other aspects of business and revenue models. \n\n• I want to know how you located and approached your early adopters to interview them. \n\n• I want to know what magical questions unlocked new insights. \n\n• I want to know what you discovered that surprised you, and how it helped you decide to persist, pivot, or perish.\n\n### Where to learn this \nMy reference points for Customer Discovery are Steve Blank’s Four Steps to Epiphany, Rob Fitzpatrick’s Mom Test, Justin Wilcox’s Customer Dev Labs and Focus Framework. You can find these books easily, and they put out many free YouTube videos and blogs. \n\nThis is the basis for what founders do on day two of a Techstars Startup Weekend— “get out of the building,” go to where they think they’ll find their customers, and interview them casually with a specific style of interviewing designed to test the risky assumptions they’ve made about any and all aspects of their proposed solution and business model.  \n\nIf you haven’t actually done Customer Discovery yourself, you’re invited to ask questions of those who have. If all of this sounds interesting, I recommend to you the authors/books above.

    "chunk_text": "Tech and non-tech co-founders: MVP first or traction first? I will not promote I’m a tech co-founder, and I wanted to share a recent experience trying to start a bootstrapped venture with a non-technical co-founder. Just sharing my side of the story. Every situation has two sides.\n\nA bit about me: I’ve built popular open source projects, launched a few tech products (built, got traction, sold), and bootstrapped two companies with 20+ full-time employees each. I’ve also had many failures in this journey.\n\nI’ve worked at several venture-backed companies, but everything I’ve built on the side has been bootstrapped. To start something new, I’ve always had at least one of the following:\n\n- I was a user myself and wanted the product\n- I had early adopters lined up, committed to using it once available\n- A strong network (mine or through co-founders)\n\nThis time, I tried YC’s Co-Founder Matching. Mostly misses, but I did find someone who seemed promising.\n\nHe was a non-technical co-founder with a strong conviction about an idea. His confidence came from:\n- Seeing many complaints from businesses using competitors (it’s a bit of a commodity space)\n- Believing that large competitors had slowed down after being acquired. No longer founder-led.\n- Assuming many businesses avoided the tools because they were bad\n- Thinking the industry is behind in tech and will need to catch up. Clients of such businesses struggle with the interactions.\n- Having worked at a company that sold for 9 figures, doing something similar for a different industry (and a much larger TAM)\n\nBut here’s the catch:\nHe had no design partners, no one committed to using it if we built it, no real validation of pain points — just personal research and assumptions.\n\nI created a 30-day go-to-market plan for him with a goal to find 2–3 design partners. He made some effort and got 1–2 meetings a week, which felt slow to me.\n\nMeanwhile, I was working on the MVP — but this wasn’t just CRUD or basic features. The core functionality was complex and time-consuming to implement. And without real user conversations, I was struggling to stay motivated.\n\nHe wanted a product to sell. I wanted to talk to real users interested in using the solution before building a full product.\n\nWe eventually parted ways — no hard feelings, just a misalignment in expectations.\n\nI’ve seen this a lot when talking to other non-technical co-founders looking for tech partners: they want a product before doing real sales work. I get it, but from the tech co-founder’s side, it quickly becomes unbalanced and riskier.\n\nIn the past, I was more open to risk. But now, older me, with fewer cycles, I’ve been more cautious. I actually turned down an opportunity that ended up becoming successful, just because it felt too risky at the time.\n\nCurious to hear from others: how would you handle this situation?",

After raise, founders don't send updates, even they are ghosting their VCs. \n\nVisible VC's research shows: Startups that send regular investor updates are 3x more likely to raise follow-on funding.

Why did this revenue jump? What did you learn about customers that nobody else knows? What hypothesis completely changed your approach?\n\nThey want to see your thinking evolve in real time.

I started when I finished my 1st year on bachelor’s degree and used it as an opportunity to grow my skills on my free time; everyone involved in the development (software) of it made it for free and on their free time.\n\nNow that my bachelor’s is finished and I have my MSc (thinking about getting the PhD), the push for my time has become much harder by the manager, even writing me at 2 AM when I told her not to this summer. She asks for more time than I have, and asks for deadlines before I can even tell her how much it will take me; mind you, I have built a lot for the product over the years.\n\nYesterday, when pushed, I got fed up and told her respectfully that I can not produce two big logical changes on two different screens on a single sunday as she told me she expected, and then she told me “she didn’t mean this sunday exactly” (bs, she is really conscious about what she says when it comes to timelines and really strict).\n\nI was thinking about leaving, but I was told by a friend “what if you tell her you can no longer work for free and ask for X€ per hour? after all, she has been paying an external programming company for over a month to do some other tasks and she pays for servers and an apple dev account”\n\n-- CONTEXT: I also work my normal job, 30k per year in Spain, 25M, and this has been more of a \"free time\" kinda thing, still unpaid and pushy for the free time part.\n\n--- UPDATE: Told the manager that I will no longer be working unless paid X€ per hour, paid upfront. Told her I find the terms of the contract she intended me to sign are unacceptable (1 year cliff, 2 of vesting for 0.8% of the final valuation - initial valuation in case of the company being sold, while being paid 0€, with them having the ability to fire me at any moment's notice if they deem that I failed to deliver 3 times in a year).\n\nWhat do you think of the situation?

I’m attempting to build my own social media app. We have our own version of communities called Circles that polls get posted in. Obviously this is a huge undertaking but I’ve learning a lot and it’s more of a passion project/hobby for me. \n\nAnyways, one of the things I’m considering is creating AI accounts to simulate more engagement for my early users. The way I want to do this is have an AI account for each circle (about 50 as of now) and posts a poll, comments on other polls, vote on polls, etc.\n\nThe dilemma is it feels weird to have AI accounts and how far do I take this. I don’t want to be like meta or twitter with bots and shady ai practices. But I could let the AI come up with personas and role play an actual user. I could (and probably should) clearly label everything as AI generated or maybe the accounts as AI\n\nHow does this concept resonate with you all? On one hand it would be fun to see how the AI vote, what kind of polls they post, a nice flow of content for early users, etc. Should I let them role play as actual users or clearly mark them as AI? The goal is to only have these until the user base grows in size then I scale back the AI accounts or keep them if the users want them \n\nAm I overthinking this?\n\nTLDR; Want to use AI accounts to simulate engagement for early users so it doesn’t feel like a waste land. How do I go about this in a way that is ethical? Should I label everything as AI generated? Should I label the accounts as AI so it’s one layer removed from content? Should I not do this?",

If expectations are clearly conveyed, everything stays good.**\n\nI have a technical business analyst AI agent which we use to breakdown projects, it's not ready for public yet but you can join the wait list. It does an extremely good technical breakdown for projects.\n\n2. UI UX Design: If you don't spend on design, don't have any expectations at all. The end product will look shabby and rushed, design brings clarity to the client's mind, you find out things that you originally missed. And remember, don't trust designers to figure out your app flow, they may not cover everything. Make sure your initial documentation is comprehensive and someone cross checks the UI UX design flow before it is sent to devs.\n\n3. Development: Don't hire low cost shit devs and expect great results. If you want low cost shit devs, expect shit and don't go around complaining. Development includes daily testing and verification of everything that is done. Every task that a dev completes has to be tested before it is marked as complete. A developer will never aggressively check his own work. It's a loss for them in fixed priced projects. It's slightly acceptable in hourly projects. But in the long run, they will never be able to find out their own mistakes.\n\nWhen we sell a dev for 45-50$/hr here's how it generally works  \n25-35 is the base dev cost  \n5 is the QA that tests everything every single day  \n5 is for the project manager that ensures on time delivery  \n5 for the business analyst that that converts every client request into a fully understandable ticket for the dev with clear expectations and expected outcomes.\n\nAll good companies sell frontend and backend separately, because most full stack devs are backend inclined and can't make very good frontend.\n\nNow if you are hiring someone for even 20$/hr, how are you going to do all the other stuff? Are you gonna micromanage everything? When will you market your product? You have to make all these decisions by yourself.\n\n4. Deployment and maintenance\n\n**Important things to remember**\n\n1. There is a base cost to everything in this world which you cannot dodge off. It's going to hit you back later.\n2. Personal opinion but, fuck you to everyone who expects random devs from the world to work solely on equity while the founder has a day job and expects others to do a full time job for free.\n3. If you don't have money to pay for a house, don't build a house, rent it, figure something else out, make money elsewhere and then build a house in a good way.\n\nPro Tips:  \n\\- Buy a full ui ux design from UI8 if you don't have money for a designer.  \n\\- Don't pay people outside fiverr or upwork if you found them there, if it's necessary you have the power of review and chargeback atleast even if it costs you 20% more. Once you have established great relationship and trust, then you can pay directly to avoid fees.  \n\\- Start marketing on day 1 of the product development using the design mockups. Otherwise no one will use your product once it is done.\n\nThe difference between a good and a bad dev is how they think about the future. For example  \nIf you ask a junior dev to code an upvote downvote mechanism, they may only think \"I want to increment this number every time someone clicks on it, very easy, it will only take an hour or max 2\". But a proper dev will think, \"Okay, so there has to be a counter, can someone upvote twice? no, which means I have to maintain a list of every userID that has upvoted and match it with the current logged in ID to make sure the same person isn't able to upvote twice. And in the future, this client may ask to view a list of people who have upvoted a post so I should maintain a fully scalable table of this upvoter list for every post because it has no upper limit. (in these cases, the bad devs or juniors sometimes only solve half of the problem and they put upvoters list within the post data which makes the post data body huge and causes problems in the future.) Hence, the senior may give an estimate for 8 hours or even 12-16 hours, in which case you do your math and think that the senior is scamming via 45$\\*16 hours where as the all great junior is the truly fast AI adapter who can only do it for 20$x1 hour.\n\n6 weeks down the road, your users ask for a list of upvoters, the junior realizes he never maintained it. He now tries to code as he should have in the beginning. It now costs more, and you end up with irreversible damage which means that all the posts in the system that are behind this certain time stage, will never have upvoters list because it have never stored. And you as the founder end up mitigating that somehow.",

    "chunk_text": "Why committing to a client budget before talking to a dev always blows up A few weeks ago, a client came to us in a bad spot.\n\nThey’d promised a fixed budget to their client, then found a dev, and handed over a rough scope. But halfway through, the dev bailed.\n\nNow they’re stuck. Most of the budget’s gone, the project’s only half done, and their reputation is taking a hit as they scramble to find someone to finish the job.\n\nWe wanted to help but the numbers didn’t work: there was no way for us to deliver meaningful work within the remaining budget.\n\nUnfortunately, we see this very often.\n\nSomeone promises their client a fixed budget before scoping the work with a developer.\n\nThen, it usually plays out like this:\n\n1.Devs say “yes” just to get started - but then reality hits. They accept the budget without fully understanding the scope (because it was never scoped properly). \n\nAs complexity unfolds, they either:\n\nA) Ghost when they realize it’s not worth it\n\nB) Or start cutting corners, rushing the work, or pushing back constantly\n\n2. Dev pushes back mid-project. Now it gets awkward.\n\nA) The middleman (you) has to go back to the client and ask for more money\n\nB) Or you’re stuck renegotiating with the dev\n\nEither way, it makes you look like you didn’t plan properly.\n\n3. You get a low-quality or inexperienced developer.\n\nIf the budget is fixed too early and it's too low, solid devs walk away. The ones who stick around might be desperate, underqualified, or hoping to upsell later.\n\nThis is all avoidable. Scope first. Price second.\n\nIf you're in this position - or want to avoid ending up there - here’s what works:\n\n1. Before giving your client a number, get a developer to review the scope and to give you a ballpark - even if it’s just a rough one.\n2. Use that input to define the real effort and edge cases with your client.\n3. Get back to developer and pay them for proper assessment and close budget estimates\n4. Then price it  with buffers for unknowns and present it to your client.\n\nThat’s how you protect your delivery, your margins, and most importantly - your reputation.",

Not selling any courses but actually sharing things other people can implement and generate sales or leads. I found that by educating others with real value it made me somewhat of a “thought leader” in the space. After some time different companies started to reach out for help and I turned a few of them into clients. Currently on year 3 of my business and I think that by giving others true value and sharing insight about what you’re good at can help someone else and spark a fruitful conversation that could lead to new business or relationships for you.",

The Great Recession of 2008 hit my family hard, teaching me the importance of always moving forward, a lesson I've applied throughout my life.\n\nIn high school, I was an all-star athlete with aspirations of becoming a medical doctor. However, a chance encounter with a stage hypnotist sparked my interest in the workings of the human mind. I saw the transformative power of hypnosis when a shy friend became more confident and outspoken after a simple stage performance. This experience set me on a path to help others unlock their hidden strengths and potential.\n\nI embarked on my coaching career at the young age of sixteen and quickly realized the need to expand my offerings. Over the years, I developed advanced, cutting-edge psychological techniques that have helped tens of thousands of people boost their confidence and work more productively towards their goals.\n\nOne of my most notable clients has been Jake Paul, the famous YouTuber and boxer. Working with Jake was a transformative experience that further solidified my belief in the power of mindset and hypnosis. My work with him and other high-profile clients has allowed me to charge up to a million dollars for my services. People find immense value in the transformation they experience through my coaching, and I am grateful for the opportunity to make such a significant impact on their lives.\n\nAs for my personal life, I've always had a passion for sport/super cars. I've owned 27 cars by the age of 24, and I'm currently eyeing another McLaren. These cars are not just symbols of material success, but they represent the freedom, achievement, and joy that come from relentlessly pursuing one's passion and goals.\n\nIm not writing this to show off but to inspire anyone.

Would a small business automation company be a good idea? By using AI and modern technology, so many tasks could be automated, saving a ton of time and money. Especially in small towns I’ve noticed that small businesses are often not that tech savvy and are stuck in the past. My co worker told me that when he was working at our local hospital, they payed someone 4K to do a presentation on ChatGPT. Businesses and small businesses especially seem desperate to keep with the times, and not get left behind by AI. I could see this being super useful for skilled trades businesses as well.

Technical users began signing up specifically for API access. Agencies, marketers with automation workflows, and folks using tools like Zapier or n8n.\n2.

Hi everyone,\n\n7 years ago I failed with my \"Airbnb for parties\" project, but I never let that idea go, and seeing success of apps like Timeleft motivated me to start a new side project, that might be about to become a serious project\n\nI have just launched a web app allowing users to join curated events, where hosts select a few attendees by matching them according to their \"vibe\", and then animate those small events allowing people to meet each other. This is targeted towards expats and locals that are around 28 years old\n\nOne of the main event concepts would be musical picnics, and I have planned to throw one in three weeks (fête de la musique day for my fellow french). But there is more to come: watergun battles, city walks, social dance classes...\n\n  \nI have loosely validated the concept with facebook and reddit posts, but I don't know how to proceed to push it further and find my first attendees for this picnic, even tho I only need 10 of them\n\n\n\nAre there specific marketing tactics for those small needs?\n\n  \nThanks!",

I had to eat that lesson. Baaddddd. \n\nI used to treat feedback like a personal attack. Like people were trying to knock me down, but once I actually shut up and *listened,* it changed my perspective*.* \n\nRunning a business ain’t a solo gig. I don’t care if you’re freelancing out your living room, doing side work on weekends, or managing a full-blown team. You’re not building this thing in a vacuum. Your customers? They don’t think like you. They don’t live your life. Their priorities, fears, and values aren’t yours. And that’s the whole damn point.\n\nYou’re not building for *you.* You’re building for *them.*\n\nLet's keep it a buck, we’re all just people. All of us. Different upbringings, different battles, different baggage. Everybody’s walking around with a life you can’t see from the outside. All of that is what shapes how people respond to your product, your message, your brand. If you don’t take the time to understand that, you’ll just end up talking to yourself.\n\nThat’s why I post here. Every comment helps. Each piece of advice, critique, or even some half-ass “nah bro” energy, I appreciate it. This community keeps me sharp, keeps me honest, and reminds me that I don’t have all the answers.\n\nI had to stop making everything so personal. Disagreement doesn't mean disrespect. It could just be some other angle I wasn't seeing because of my own upbringing. My own biases. You don’t lose anything by listening. You gain awareness. You catch things you missed. You grow something way bigger than your original plan.\n\nAs usual, I believe in all of you. Good luck and stay blessed.",

We are a service-based company that demands highly competent manpower. I'm sure many of you would emphatize, that at this cutrent expansion stage, there is little room to hire entry-level staff to offer significant level of guidance. Our skillsets are niche. We are generally hiring individuals with some years of experience to fill our demand requirements. \n\nHowever, it has came to my realization that we've had multiple staff tendering during the probation period. Many of which are a result of low competency (and pressures that come along with it). In part it's a judgement and hiring pool issue.\n\nBut I'm starting to wonder if it had anything to do with my management style. I would say that my expectation of staff is pretty high, while not unreasonable (or so in my opinion).\n\nSome examples: \n\n- I like to ask questions to understand why recommendations by employees are made, rather than providing answers and resolution upfront (which doesn't encourage critical thinking, since answers are often scenario specific). In addition, questions are intended to identify if employees have done their research and homework to derive at their answers. So long as recommendations are well thought out, i would approve their work. But more than likely, for employees who lack competency, it may feel impossible to derive at a reasonable recommendation.\n\n- I tend to read into the future too much, and like to help employees achieve growth. How that translates however, may be a moving target board for employees. Now that we've achieved X, how do we do better in Y. Granted, these are often backed with promotion and growth opportunities.\n\nThe work is mostly remote. The lack if face time and personal touch may play a role.\n\nIm wondering if anyone may be facing or have overcomed similar scenarios that may share some tips of how i could be a better boss.",

I am not talking about only reach, but also regarding educating the customers. As far as I know, social media is the only way to educate a customer regarding a product and its features. Even if a competitor has an inferior quality product but better marketing team and spend, they take the customers/sales (I am saying this out of personal experience). At the end of the day, does the quality of the product matter that little? should one invest in marketing and advertising instead of product development?  I don't really agree to this but that seems like the reality. As entrepreneurs, what do you all think?",

I started off doing house cleanings, advertising on craigslist getting paid in cash. \n\nI picked up a lot of work from realtors early on so I realized there was money there so I switched my focus to only targeting agents, property management companies and just stay in the real estate world rather than targeting your avg client or homeowner. \n\nas work picked up I just started offering the rest of the services. Agents would always ask, hey do you know a painter, or a carpet cleaner , handyman , tree guy... \n\ninstead of passing on the leads I would just reply yeah send me the address and we'll go check it out. Things just happened naturally so eventually I stepped back from the field to manage it all, I have too many jobs going on at once, so time doesn't allow for me to go out and perform these service myself anymore.\n\n>How feasible is it for someone else to get started?\n\nIt’s definitely doable. I didn’t wait long to sub out and scale. Like I already mentioned, early on, I was only offering house cleanings to realtors, and that’s it. I wouldn’t take on construction cleanings, commercial jobs, or maid service for occupied homes. I just focused on move-in/move-out cleanings because, in my opinion, they’re easier to manage.\n\nOnce I figured out my little marketing system, just sending out emails to realtors and subbing out the house cleanings in my area, I went all out. I started doing house cleanings in multiple cities like Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Denver, Seattle, Provo, New York, Orlando, and Miami.\n\nEventually, as my local workload grew, I slowly stopped marketing in those other cities and focused on Texas.\n\n Pick a niche that has repeat work and focus on that. Build your system around it, get your subcontractors in place, and don’t overthink it.",

With a 60% margin ($100+ profit) as well, I'm very confident in the product itself and and the future of our company. \n\nAt the moment we're just waiting for the latest batch we've been purchasing from our factory to be shipped to us which we will then use to complete certifications with the governing bodies of the sport. This should be done by about August 15th or so. We've been spending a lot of our time learning about how we can make our product even better in the future, and also just learning about every single little step along the way so we can best prepare for sales and public conversations. At this point, we're even planning on spending the next two months creating verbal commitments with local vendors across the USA to get wholesale deals ready so we have guaranteed sales and buzz. This \n\nMy Concerns: I feel like I'm losing my soul in the current corporate job. I don't love what I do, and I feel like it wastes a lot of my time and energy. I spent a few days with my business partner that lives in a different state, and focusing on the company made me feel like a new man. I've hinted to my family at quitting my current job to focus on this company a few times now, and they react as if it's the end of the world. After having worked 4 years already in corporate America, I feel like it's not a crazy plan to see how this company goes for a year. At worst it would look great on a resume right? But I genuinely don't think we can fail given how hard my partner and I are working. I'm losing sleep thinking about this. And I'm also losing sleep trying to juggle the three (company, work, and masters).",

    "chunk_text": "I'm Starting a Root Beer Company! Seeking Advice Hi Reddit! Recently, I was let go from my job and I've decided to start a new journey on my own! There is a local restaurant that brews their own root beer and I approached them to start a joint venture where I would bottle their product and sell it locally to restaurants and stores to start. I'm new to all of this and could use some advice. I would love to talk to someone in this space or read any comments with helpful tips. From what I've seen, using a copacker is the quickest and cheapest way to get started. My plan is to have the recipe licensed to my LLC, then take it to a copacker to have a sample batch created of around 100-200 bottles. Once I have the bottles and packaging sorted, my plan is to offer local restaurants and stores my product by giving them the product (let's say 50 bottles to start) at no cost upfront, and then collect on sales after some time has passed. I figure no risk on their end would be a good enough incentive for them to house my root beer. What do you guys think? Again, I'm open to any and all advice/connections.",

About a year ago, I launched my first app. I had poured everything into it — months of work, late nights, a lot of hope. I was excited. Launch day came... and nothing happened.\n\nLiterally 0 sales.  \nThat kind of silence hits hard when you've been dreaming big. I started questioning everything — my idea, my skills, even if I should keep building.\n\nStill, I couldn’t let go. So I gave it another shot with a second app — this time, it actually started working. People found value in it. I had paying users, recurring revenue, things were finally clicking.\n\nThen… I faced an unexpected setback and had to rebuild everything from scratch.\n\nI’ll admit, that broke me for a bit. But something about starting over again felt different this time. I realized I wasn’t building for the money or the market anymore — I wanted to solve *my* own problem.\n\nI’d always struggled with consistency. Whether it was health, productivity, or side projects — I started strong, but dropped off after a few days or weeks.  \nSo I built a small app to help me stay consistent. Something that would turn a big goal into a personalized daily plan, remind me at the right time, and keep me on track.\n\nI made it just for myself.\n\nBut it worked.  \nFor the first time, I didn’t quit halfway.\n\nSo I decided to put it out there — it’s now called **Luminario**, and it just launched on the App Store (after rebuilding everything under a new account from scratch). I’m not chasing vanity metrics anymore. I just want to help people like me stay on track.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt crushed by failure or burned out by rebuilding… I get it. I’ve been there — more than once.  \nBut starting again might lead to something better than you planned.\n\nHappy to share what I’ve learned if it helps — and would love to hear your story too.",

I believe it’ll pay off in the long run.\n\nOur only pain point is Review acquisition. Any tips, potential downsides, or upsides you can share on that?\n\nIf you bought a guru course, mentorship, or any other program for starting your small business (good or bad experience), how likely would you be to spend a couple of minutes writing a review on a platform to help others?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1l22je8)",

    "chunk_text": "Built a niche B2B marketplace that's been getting organic traction since day one – now exploring payment options, partnership, or potential exit Hey everyone,\n\nI launched a niche B2B marketplace back in 2020, (Hemp Trade Market) just before the pandemic hit. Even though I never ran paid ads or did any serious marketing, the platform started picking up traction right away. Real users, real listings, real interest – all organic.\n\nAt some point during COVID, I made the platform completely free and shifted my attention to other projects. But despite that, the site kept getting signups, product inquiries, and traffic on its own.\n\nOriginally, I handled payments manually using Square’s “pay by link” – I’d vet users and then send them a payment link. People actually paid, but obviously it wasn’t scalable or automated, and had no support for subscriptions or billing logic.\n\n\n---\n\nNow I’m at a point where I want to figure out the next move. I’m open to three paths:\n\n1. Payment processor – I’m looking for a provider that allows monthly recurring billing, ideally something that works with high-risk or restricted industries (this part matters – Stripe doesn’t support it). Any solid recommendations would be super helpful.\n\n\n2. Partnership – If someone sees the potential in this space and wants to jump in as a co-founder, growth partner, or investor – I’m open to serious conversations.\n\n\n3. Acquisition / Exit – I’m also open to selling the platform if it’s the right fit. The product works, the niche is validated, and the traction is real.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you've got experience in this space, know of a good payment setup, or are interested in teaming up or taking over – let’s talk.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "chunk_text": "Early traction, strong feedback — and we’re stuck. How do you survive this stage? I am a first year uni student (my co-founders, also students, pooled our money to fund this) and we have been building an AI-powered anime companion app focused on emotional interactivity and long-term connection that goes beyond normal AI chatbots you see. I started working on this after a long hospital stay where I discovered AI chatbots which made me smile when I was, to be honest, depressed and lonely.\n\nIt’s fully bootstrapped, and we reached 8k downloads and $5k in lifetime revenue (currently $600 MRR) all with a single character — with basically 1 character alone (now 2 characters). All revenue was from subscriptions or in-app purchases for items.\n\nWe’re running out of cash though. Each character is fully custom, not just a reskin or voice swap. They have unique personalities, Live2D models, voice models, and dialogue behavior, all trained on hand-curated datasets to make their interactions feel consistent and emotionally engaging. And we can see it’s working pretty well, with people spending an average of 20 mins per session and multiple sessions throughout the day.\n\nDue to the resource-intensive nature, I am trying to either raise some funds or scale it without raising — which will be pretty hard, especially since we will have no money left to commission art and an engineer for frontend (I do backend). Technically, if we fire everyone and did no updates, we will be able to sustain ourselves as long as the subscribers are there.\n\nBeyond subscriptions, we’re planning to lean heavily into gacha mechanics for cosmetic items and limited events, a proven monetization model in anime and mobile games. We’re also building toward a much broader vision: companions that live with you beyond the app. Whether that’s chatting on Discord, sharing and commenting on posts on social media, or even gaming together, we want these characters to be real, portable parts of people’s digital lives. Not just something you talk to, but something you play with, grow with, and form a real bond with.\n\nBut anime often gets dismissed as niche, even though it has one of the most obsessive fandoms and has some of the highest earning games of all time.\n\nWould love advice on how to make the pitch compelling to angels or VCs, especially with limited network — or how to keep this project alive?\n\nPS: Additionally, this is not the first app we have worked on together. We have made some other apps like ringtone, B2B social media manager software, and even a piracy app when we were younger (we started working together on projects when we were 14–15). We also sold the B2B and ringtone app, which acted as funding for this project.",

    "chunk_text": "European-Based Startup. Looking for a Developer to Join Me as a Technical Partner (AI Productivity App, MVP Exists) Hey everyone,\n\nA month ago, I posted here looking for a developer. Back then, I found a partner and we worked together on the first phase. We successfully got an initial MVP version of my product built: an AI-powered productivity app with a focus on Neurodivergence and cognitive systems. The concept is solid, documentation exists, and the foundation is fully defined.\n\nHowever, due to personal circumstances, my partner is no longer continuing with the project. We’ve closed everything off properly, and I retain full rights to the current codebase and system design.\n\nNow I’m looking for a new technical partner to continue from here. Someone who’s interested not just in writing code, but in growing with me long-term, potentially taking the CTO or Lead Engineer role as the product evolves into a real business. I am not looking for short-term contractors or Fiverr devs — I want a collaborator who sees the upside in building something serious together.\n\n**What exists today:**\n\n* Fully defined system architecture & documentation\n* An MVP with working features\n* A fully registered company (Portugal-based, but open to Europe in general)\n* Early business plan & monetization strategy\n* Some IP filings and protective steps already taken\n\n**The tech stack (so far):**\n\n* Custom AI interaction layers\n* Web front-end (React) + TS\n* Node + TS\n* Postgres\n* Qdrant ready for enhancing context\n* Backend infrastructure and cloud setup\n* GitHub repo fully available\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n* Europe-based (ideally similar time zones)\n* Ambitious but realistic, understands early stage realities\n* Comfortable taking ownership of the technical direction\n* Someone who values structure, clarity, and long-term vision\n* Willing to collaborate on architecture, product direction, and scalability\n* Ideally familiar with AI, LLMs, or productivity software (not a hard requirement)\n\nThis is still an early-stage startup, but one where a lot of foundation work has already been done. The goal is simple: build a product that generates real revenue and profit. There’s real market potential if we execute right.\n\nWhen I originally posted here, quite a few people reached out. Some I had to turn down because I had already partnered with someone. So now I’m returning to this community to see if the right person is still out there.\n\nIf you're curious or think this might be a fit, feel free to DM me and we can have a chat.",

    "chunk_text": "Building 2025's best AI UGC platform, locally Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an entrepreneur working in AI SaaS. At the start of the year, I took a deep dive into a AI image/video space. Learnt how to use and serve the tech on websites.\n\nWas always interested in UGC, and wanted to help users make easy and good videos. Theres platforms already out here charging subscriptions, like $20 a month for 10 videos. I didn't wanna hop on that trend. I realized there's many people out there who don't wanna pay subscriptions for AI UGC videos.\n\nSo I built the ultimate self hosted solution. Self hosting is when you have the website code on your laptop and can start it up at any time. You bring your own API key (which is essentially a key that powers the AI, from our provider) so you can control your own budget.\n\nThe solution itself is extremely in depth. Hook + product videos with captions or voices, floating heads, avatars, product holding, green screen corner videos, slideshows, etc. All viral tiktok formats can be achieved with it. Best part is I made 20 videos for $0.02 - compare that to what id be paying on another platform.\n\nI've grown the community to 75+ users, and am regularly updating the platform. Hoping to continue to grow it to be the de facto AI UGC solution for those who are aware that self hosting is simply the better option when it comes to AI websites.",

After months of building, doubting myself, and wondering if anyone would actually want what I'm creating.\n\n**The crazy part?** I haven't even officially launched yet.\n\n**Here's what happened:**\n\nI've been posting about my journey building StartupIdeaLab dot io - a tool that finds validated SaaS ideas by scraping real customer complaints and pain points. Instead of waiting for the \"perfect launch,\" I just put it out there with a clean landing page and a working MVP.\n\nNo fancy marketing. No big announcements. Just genuine posts about solving a problem I had myself.\n\n**The lesson that hit me hard:**\n\nIf your product solves a real problem, someone out there is desperately looking for exactly what you're building. They don't care if it's \"officially launched\" or has all the bells and whistles.\n\nThey just want their problem solved.\n\n**What I learned:**\n\n* Don't wait for perfection to start marketing\n* Someone is always willing to pay for a solution that saves them time or makes them money\n* Your biggest competitor isn't other products - it's people doing things manually\n* Building in public works because it attracts the right people\n\n**The person who bought it?** They're probably tired of spending hours researching startup ideas manually. My tool does in minutes what used to take them days.\n\nThat's worth $199 to them. Easy decision.\n\n**If you're building something:**\n\nStop waiting. Put it out there. Share your progress. Be genuine about the problem you're solving.\n\nSomeone needs exactly what you're creating right now.\n\nI'm ready for launch now and working on improvements based on user feedback. If you've ever struggled with finding validated business ideas, I'd love your thoughts.\n\nWhat was your first dollar moment like?

How tough is it to secure funding at this stage?\n\nDo college tag comes to play?

Although, I will be bootstrapping few parts - like company registration (which itself costs around 10k), domain name, cloud fees (for prototype), etc. But for hiring UI designer, for marketing, etc - I need funding...\n\nI tried reaching out to designers where I promised them to pay them after I am able to secure funding or the app is able to make any revenue.

No tech background, no team, just a pile of frustration and some experience writing for small businesses.\n\nI noticed something odd: so many small business owners struggle with content planning. They're either overpaying for “strategies” that are just glorified templates or spending hours trying to come up with blog ideas each week. That felt fixable.\n\nSo I gave myself 21 days to build a solution. Here’s what I’ve done so far:\n\n* **Built a tool** that generates a full content strategy + blog posts + LinkedIn content using AI\n* Tried Claude and others, but eventually used Gemini Advanced for content generation\n* Narrowed scope to blog + LinkedIn after testing other formats\n* Started on Replit, moved to Render (cheaper, more flexible)\n* Tried self-hosting LLaMA (big mistake), now using LLM APIs\n* Stripe didn’t work in India, so I’m midway integrating Razorpay\n* Site is live but payments not active yet\n* Cold email campaigns are warming up\n* Spent more money than I planned on infra + email tooling 😬\n\nGoal for June: **first 50–100 active users**. Not monetized yet — just trying to validate and learn.\n\nThis is my first serious attempt at building a product. Would love feedback or advice on:\n\n* Getting early users without a budget\n* What *not* to do when launching\n* Whether building in public helps with credibility\n\nAlso happy to answer anything about how I built this with no-code and LLM APIs.\n\nThanks for reading!",

The idea is people land there and interact with the agent directly — no UI, no intro text, just start chatting.\n\nIt’s definitely different. A few people said it felt more engaging than scrolling through a site or reading docs. Others were confused at first. Still early, but interesting enough that I’m continuing to test it.\n\nCurious if anyone else is building in this direction. Could public AI agents become the new homepage?",

    "chunk_text": "Why a Prelaunch Waitlist Might Be the Most Important Thing You Do One of the toughest lessons I’ve had to learn is that marketing is as important, if not more important than your product. I spent 3 weeks silently developing my last software, and when I finally launched… nothing happened. No one signed up because no one even knew or cared that my software existed.\n\nWith my new start up however, I’ve been trying hard to get as many prelaunch sign ups as I possibly can, and so far 200 people have signed up and I strongly believe this launch is gonna go much much better.\n\nThe most common concern I hear about marketing prelaunch (and the one I had as well) is that your competitors may copy your idea and launch before you. However, the truth is copy cats only have so much time and resources, and it is much more likely that they will copy an idea that is already proven to work, rather than come steal your “not-even fully formed, has no guarantee that it will ever work” idea.\n\nThe second reason why a prelaunch waitlist is so important is that it validates your idea. I now know that people actually want the thing I’m building. How disappointing would it be to find out nobody wants your product AFTER you have spent all your time and money into it…\n\nIf you aren’t marketing prelaunch, I hope this post at least made you consider it.\n\nCheers🎊",

But it turns out that's not the case. \n\nHowever, I think my numbers could be improved after I have my assistant message the people who've had active conversations with me versus inactive. I just need to approve the leads. There's about 200. So there's still time to get my first 25 affiliates. I'm just moving slow. \n\nI am working with a content coach. I've got 2 accounts I'm posting on 3x per day. And I'm repurposing across like 3 platforms. \n\nI might land my very first 1:1 client this month. Maybe multiple. Through LinkedIn. So that'll be fun. \n\nI know my program and coaching gets results as I've run a group coaching program in the past.

I'm on my 6th year of trying to build another business where I can have more freedom + impact. That's 5 hard years of failure and lessons learned. \n\nI will not stop going until I make it work.

But the people I actually want to reach are founders and marketers, who’d actually buy or benefit from what I’m building.\n\nThe problem is: if your first 500-1000 views don’t get solid engagement, LinkedIn buries the post. And if your network isn’t your ideal audience, you’re kind of screwed.\n\nWhat worked was this:\n\n**Write for the wrong people in the hook.**  \n**Switch to your real audience in the body.**\n\nIt feels obvious in hindsight, but the only way to pull it off consistently is with help. You’d normally need a strategist or ghostwriter to plan content like this. I didn’t want that.\n\nSo I built a system using ChatGPT and Claude.\n\nThe setup:\n\n1. I connect my LinkedIn content (past posts, bio, voice) to a custom GPT or Claude chat\n2. Prompt:“What topics from my last 5 posts resonated most? Give me 3 new post ideas.”\n3. Pick one, then:“I like idea 2. Please write it in my style. \\[OPTIONAL\\] Follow this narrative: ...”\n4. And the key part:“My network is mostly engineers but I want to reach founders. Rewrite the hook to engage engineers but make sure the body speaks to founders.”\n\nThat prompt alone unlocked the whole strategy.\n\nWe’ve done 3 posts with this setup that passed 10K impressions, 2 that crossed 100K+.  \nAll written and posted in under 10 minutes *from the chat interface itself.*\n\nIf you're bootstrapping and trying to grow on LinkedIn without hiring writers or spending hours crafting content, this might help.\n\nIf you're interested in trying out the GPT, search for LiGo for Linked on GPT store.\n\nI've been growth hacking on Linkedin for more than 12 months and have garnered over 6M impressions across 3 profiles in the last 6 months.

Originally I thought my idea was so brilliant it would solve all issues in a very large market.\n\nMaybe one day it will, but I spent so much time trying to develop a product that would work for such a huge market.  I don't know when it clicked in, but why build features if no one will ever see them.\n\nNiche Down - get your target market, or ICP.  Narrow it down.  Narrow it down again, then narrow it down until you can picture the real user in your head.\n\nFrom there, research that user and remove any feature that doesn't help them.  This becomes your minimum viable product (MVP)\n\nUse the various AI's to confirm that everything you have planned is really needed to be in your MVP.  Example, you don't need full google integration or Oauth sign ins for your MVP.  That can be release 2.\n\n  \nAsk your friends and family to test.  Don't even think about other users until you make the required adjustments based on your family and friends feedback.\n\nGet feedback from various communities, there's a ton of them and people are willing to help.\n\nBe very aware that you will like your product because you built it, even if it is something you would otherwise not like.  I can't tell you how many versions of the website I made, and my initial refusal to change the color scheme wasted weeks of my time.  Don't be me.\n\nUse AI where you can.  I shouldn't have asked chat to write this, it would have taken me 30 seconds to stick in a few thoughts, but for whatever reason I've been trying this out for 5 minutes.\n\nChatGPT Summary:\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAfter some reflection, the author shares key lessons from their startup journey:\n\n1. **Don’t Build for Everyone** – Initially, they aimed to serve a massive market but realized that building features for unseen users is wasted effort. Instead, they advise to *niche down* repeatedly until you can clearly picture your ideal customer.\n2. **Refine Your MVP** – Strip your product down to only what your target user needs. Use AI to validate which features are essential. Leave advanced integrations (like Google or OAuth) for later versions.\n3. **Test with Trusted Circles First** – Start with friends and family for feedback before worrying about broader users.\n4. **Stay Open to Feedback** – Don’t get too attached to your work. The author admits wasting time resisting changes like a color scheme simply because it was their idea.\n5. **Use AI Wisely** – AI can save time, but even simple tasks are sometimes faster by hand—don't overthink it.\n\n**Core Message:** Focus sharply on a small, clear user base, build only what they need, iterate based on real feedback, and don’t let ego or overengineering slow you down.",

I’m a developer and recently built a headshot generator using a fine-tuned `flux-dev` model. The results are honestly pretty good — most of them look studio-quality, and I was excited about putting it out there.\n\nSince I truly believe in the quality, I wanted to make it **risk-free** for people to try. So I offered a **100% no-questions-asked refund guarantee** if someone doesn’t love their headshots — no strings, no small print. I haven’t seen other tools doing this (and if they do, there’s usually some catch).\n\nI posted about this on Twitter and LinkedIn, but got no response.\n\nPeople still seemed hesitant. So I figured — maybe they need to **see the results** first. That’s when I started FreeAIHeadshots — a subreddit where I give away **10 headshots for free** to 3 people every day.\n\nThe idea is: by showcasing free results publicly, people might gain enough trust to try it themselves.\n\nBut now I’m stuck. I thought giving away something valuable (premium AI headshots that people usually pay for) would naturally attract attention, but it hasn’t taken off yet. And subreddits like `acting`, `modelling` etc. won’t allow these posts, even though I’m giving real value.\n\nSo I’m honestly not sure what to do next. I’ve put in the work, and I know the product delivers — but getting early traction has been tougher than expected.\n\nWould love any advice from this community:\n\n* How would you promote something like this without sounding spammy?\n* Is there a better way to use Reddit for early traction?\n* What would you do if you were in my place?\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who replies — really appreciate your time.",

    "chunk_text": "An approach to small business risk assessment The concept of risk assessment isn’t usually top of mind when you first start a business. Tell me if this applies (or applied) to you: \n\nYou dive in headfirst with enthusiasm and a decent business plan. Six months later, you’re scrambling because a supplier suddenly went out of business or the most powerful person in the world decided to get trigger-happy with tariffs. What’s your next step?\n\nSo, today I thought I'd share a systematic approach to risk assessment that can help in these situations.\n\nThe process starts with identifying potential risks across different categories: \n\n* Financial (cash flow problems, unexpected expenses), \n* Operational (supply chain disruptions, equipment failures), \n* Compliance (regulatory changes), \n* Reputational (negative reviews), \n* External (market shifts, economic changes) \n* Digital (data breaches, server outages)\n\nFor each category, brainstorm specific scenarios that are relevant to your business. What if a major client doesn't pay on time? What happens if you need to replace key equipment unexpectedly? What if there's a sudden regulatory change in your industry?\n\nOnce you have a solid list, you start evaluating each risk using a simple impact and likelihood assessment. Classify each risk's potential impact as low, medium, or high, and its likelihood as unlikely, possible, or likely. This makes it easier to identify and prioritize the risks that need immediate attention. A server outage might be highly impactful but unlikely, while minor supplier delays might be likely but low impact.\n\nOnce you have your significant risks, you can develop specific response strategies for how to address them. Some risks can be avoided entirely by changing how you operate. Others can be controlled by implementing preventive measures. Some risks must be accepted as part of doing business, while others can be transferred through insurance or outsourcing.\n\nImplementation is where the rubber meets the road. Set up emergency funds, create redundancies in critical systems, develop alternate supplier relationships, and getting appropriate insurance coverage.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that this isn’t a one time thing. You need to regularly monitor and review your risk assessments. Every quarter or bi-annually, you should revisit it to track how effective mitigation strategies have been, identify new risks, and adjust plans based on changes in your business or market conditions.\n\nWhat I've found particularly useful is tracking “near miss” situations where something almost went wrong but didn't. These are valuable warning signs that help refine the risk assessment process.\n\nI know it may seem like a lot of work, but it's an incredibly helpful practice. Instead of being constantly anxious about what might go wrong, it gives you concrete plans in place for likely scenarios. And considering what’s going on these days, I’d recommend starting sooner rather than later...\n\nFor those of you who do conduct risk assessments, how helpful are you finding your approach? And are there any particular risks that keep you up at night?",

I’m a solo founder working on a tool that came from a real-world pain point in my family.\n\nMy mom does a lot of thrifting and flipping on Poshmark, and was constantly overwhelmed with paper receipts, forgotten purchase prices, and chaotic spreadsheets, especially during tax season.\n\nI looked for a tool to help her keep track of inventory and profit based on her receipts… and couldn’t find one that actually fit (or wasn’t stupid expensive). So I started building my own.\n\nHere’s the MVP so far:\n-User uploads a photo of a sourcing receipt\n-It parses each item into editable, structured data (item name, price, store, etc)\n-You select which ones to add to your inventory\n-When something sells, you log it — and it shows your profit/ROI\n-It gives you a simple dashboard showing what’s listed, what’s sold, what’s stale, and your total profit\n\nIt’s a tool for small resellers (not marketplaces themselves) and helps turn a stack of crumpled receipts into a clear picture of what’s working and what’s not.\n\nRight now, I’m in active build + validation. I’m not monetizing yet, just trying to see:\n-If this is a real enough pain to sustain a product\n-What features would be most useful\n-If this has legs beyond Poshmark into other niche seller markets\n\nCurious if anyone here has:\n-Built a tool for niche operators (e.g., resellers, solo service providers, hobbyists)\n-Tips on customer discovery in super fragmented communities\n-Thoughts on whether something like this could grow into a solid SaaS (vs staying “small tool” territory)\n\nAppreciate any honest thoughts or direction!",

Talk to people.\n\nI wanted to share a personal story about how I almost let BigIdeasDB go before it ever had a chance.\n\nI’ve built over 8 projects before this. Some shipped, some didn’t. Most flopped. At one point, I had started working on what eventually became BigIdeasDB, a platform that helps founders find real, validated problems to build around. I had the idea, started scraping Reddit posts, Upwork listings, G2 reviews… but I paused.\n\nBack then, I had a habit of stopping halfway. I’d build something, lose confidence when it didn’t immediately take off, and jump to the next thing. That almost happened with this one too.\n\nAt the time, I had a working prototype. I could generate startup ideas from Reddit threads, analyze SaaS gaps from reviews, and turn freelance gigs into product ideas. I even shared a small post or two, got decent engagement, some messages, but nothing crazy.\n\nI almost gave up again.\n\nBut something told me this time was different. So I kept going. I finished the MVP. I posted consistently. I asked for feedback. I improved it weekly based on what people actually wanted.\n\nNow BigIdeasDB has over 3,000 users and has made $16,000 in revenue.\n\nLooking back, I realize how many projects I gave up on just before they might have worked.\n\nThat’s why I’m sharing this.

    "chunk_text": "(FREE) Idea and a Proof of Concept: Start your online business with free tools and (almost) zero investment This is my first post on r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, and it is a longer one. TL;DR in the first comment.\n\nI created this post to validate an idea and share it with the community of builders and creators. I'm looking forward to talking with you and am open to any suggestions.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nWhat this is not:\n\n* This is **not a guide** to starting a company (in my honest opinion, 'company' is not 'business'; however, company is used to run a business).\n* This is **not a detailed walkthrough** guide.\n* This is **not a get-rich-quick** or get-rich-easy scheme\n* This is not a  **\"you won't spend anything\"** guide. You at least spend your time\n* I am **not affiliated** with any of the platforms I suggested here in any way.\n\nWhy I share and what this is:\n\n* This is an idea on how you can **start simple** and (almost) **free**.\n* I share **because I care.** I believe that any human with the desire to work should be able to start for free and at least cover their weekly groceries with their skills, packaged as a product.\n* This **idea and POC** rely on skills and knowledge suited for **digital products** (e.g., you are a pastry chef, and you are selling your best-performing recipes in a digital book)\n* Ultimately, my **goal** is to receive a response from the community of builders, makers, creators, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and engineers, and then create something that will **benefit all** of us.\n\n**How it started**\n\nI am a software engineer starting my solopreneurship journey. For a long while, I have been trying to move away from the rat race of working for companies and work for myself.\n\nI live in a country where the opportunities for earning money online through content creation are limited. Here, starting the company is akin to rocket science, and maintaining it is comparable to keeping a space station operational. There is considerable potential, but numerous obstacles. So, if I am to create something complex, I will spend time (time is money, after all) and money (money is money, after all).\n\nI came up with these rules to start the business online:\n\n* Start simple, dead simple\n* Don't spend (a lot of) money\n* Use the available and free tools to start\n* No need for company formation\n* Money earned should be easy to move to your bank account\n\n**The business template**\n\nBy following successful solopreneurs, creators, and makers like Justin Welsh, Mat Gray, and John Rush, among others, I observed what they say starting a business online should be and how it should start.\n\nSo here is the observed template:\n\n1. **Select your niche** (what you are doing daily, what you like doing, what you are passionate about)\n2. **Niche down** (go from the broader audience, like \"cooking and recipes\", to a more targeted audience, like \"the most famous recipes from the streets of South America\", you get the idea)\n3. **Find distribution channels** (newsletters, social networks, forums, anywhere your audience spends time; this is the start of marketing)\n4. **Build your audience first** (people spend months, even years, building products no one ever uses, so before building your product, build the audience)\n5. **Create value** by sharing (be yourself, your thoughts sent to the world are what is key in all of this)\n6. **Collect insights** (this is what helps you define what the product is)\n7. **Build a product** (solve a problem, build a feature, create something your audience needs and values)\n8. **Monetize the product** (get some value back)\n9. **Scale your business** (use new insights to improve and then scale)\n\n**The idea**\n\nTo cover these points, I came up with this collection of online tools that offer a free account with a lot of value upfront ->\n\n1. Create with Notion\n2. Publish with Substack\n3. Sell with Lemonsqueezy\n\n**Explanation**\n\n**Notion** allows you to create content, publish pages, and integrate with other services. All for free, some features are limited, but it is a simple start. It features a user interface that even non-technical users can easily use. Additionally, it offers free tutorials to help you learn how to use it.\n\nIt covers **creating value** and even **building product** requirements.\n\n**Substack** is free, and it allows you to build a following with zero investment. It already has a diverse audience, and you can easily find your target audience there. It even allows you to make money with the paid content section. And the most important part is that it promotes your content on its network, so you get seen without paying anything.\n\nIt covers finding **distribution channels**, **building your audience first**, and **collecting insights** requirements.\n\n**Lemonsqueezy** is free to open, although you must pass the verification process and have a website where you can market your product. And this is the only option where I spent money to make the store legitimate and get verified. I bought a domain for under $10 and made a site that I host for free on Cloudflare.\n\n**Proof of Concept**\n\nThis section included links to the POC and promoted a concept, not a paid product. But, to comply with the rules regarding DMs and links, I removed all references. So here is the best explanation of how the POC I built works.\n\n**Notion (free site)**\n\nI decided to go with my website for the reasons mentioned in the Lemonsqueezy section above. However, this was an example of how you can build a site with Notion and promote your product in that way.\n\n**Website (marketing + store)**\n\nContains the description of one free product, a digital guide made with Notion and converted to PDF with some random Chrome browser extension.\n\nWhen you click on the product, you are directed to a Lemonsqueezy-hosted payment form, where you can either pay a specified amount or enter 0 and leave your email as a \"price\" for a free guide.\n\nAdditionally, it features a Substack-hosted subscription form, allowing visitors to stay informed about new products.\n\n**Note**: When you submit the form to receive the free guide, it does not get sent because my store on Lemonsqueezy is currently on hold. I have a free product, and they don't like that; they want you to have paid products so that they can make money too. So, my following product needs to be a paid product for the store to go live. (I already have an idea to build on this free one).\n\n**Publication:** Substack\n\nI made one post about what this publication is about, and it has an AI-generated image I made for fun to showcase that \"beginnings are hard\", but there is a solution to start simple. I made a promise to provide a guide like this in the next post, and even promised to post every two weeks, which I did not keep. BUT I intend to return to this as just one post made me 13 followers on the platform.\n\nI haven't refined this post, and not a single letter was generated by AI (except that I use Grammarly to help me fix mistakes and suggest improvements; English is not my native language). This is just me sharing what is on my mind and what I work on.",

Although I don’t know what budget and connections they’ve had.\n\nI don’t know if I have such bad luck or what, but I have a tremendous problem when reaching out to people, organizations, or media. If anyone even bother to respond, then it is either just a statement that this is ‘such an important and needed project’ (but it seems not so important for them to support it), and they ‘wish me luck’ (I can’t do anything with wishes), or if they even declare initial interest and support it ends with ghosting. Not to mention a few openly hostile encounters.\n\nIf everyone who declared their support went through with their promises, I’d be already planting, and here I am, stuck in a chicken-and-egg situation, where people expect me to show completed projects, while I need initial support to even start them.\n\nI just don’t know what to do to keep it going…",

    "chunk_text": "I built a tool for founders who hate marketing and SEO: here’s the story and why it matters Hey ridealong crew. I posted when I started the journey, thought I'd give an update.\n\nI’ve spent the last year building LaunchBot, a set of growth tools for founders who are drowning in marketing and just need practical help to get growth.\n\n# Why I built it:\n\nAfter years working as a growth marketer, I kept seeing good ideas that were stagnating. Some of them were impact ideas that would genuinely have improved the world, but they jsut couldn't get off the ground. Not because the product sucked, but because the founder was already doing 100 things, and figuring out SEO or social network algos was just one more brick in the backpack.\n\nMy work was to manually help people: doing analytics reviews, running SEO, writing blog posts, optimizing sites, improving conversion funnels, building strategy. But I had too many clients and each step took too long. So I built launchbot to do it better than I could.\n\n# What it does:\n\n**1. SEO Tool (for people who hate SEO)**  \n→ Drop in your site, your product, your platform (Shopify, Squarespace, etc.)  \n→ It figures out your tone, offer, and drills into your website data to profile your paying customer  \n→ Then gives you:\n\n* Search terms that are relevant to your paying customers\n* Content to help you rank for those terms\n* Page-by-page tweaks to optimize your website for search\n* Then it tracks how your search rank improves for those terms\n\nBasically just “here’s how to get found online.”\n\n**2. Post Generator (kill content chaos)**  \n→ It learns your voice, and spits out posts that actually sound like you  \n→ Platform-specific (because what slaps on IG flops on LinkedIn)  \n→ Images, Captions, CTAs, done in seconds\n\nIt’s not “5 habits of successful people” filler. It’s “here’s a post that might actually convert.”\n\n**3. Strategy Mode (who is your customer, really?)**  \n→ It trawls your website data to determine your most valuable customer  \n→ Then it maps out how to reach them: no theory, just steps  \n→ Includes non-ad, non-social-media methods to find them, for those that hate giving $ to the beast\n\n# Who it’s for:\n\nFounders who want growth without wasting time. Micro marketers that don't have $25k budgets and need to put every dollar to work.\n\nI wanted to share because I see lots of us on this sub. If you’re building something good but struggling to get eyes on it, this might help.  \nLaunchbot is still improving every day. Feedback fuels it. Wins come from the wild. Feel free to use (or tear apart).\n\nAsk me anything. Happy to talk build process, tech stack, pricing philosophy, founder burnout, or whatever else you’re wrestling with.\n\nLet’s grow good ideas faster 🚀",

    "chunk_text": "I built an app that lets users read news without any filter, but I'm having a hard time making it grow Hello Reddit,\n\nFor the past three years, I have been developing a news aggregator app called Newsreadeck. I like to read news from several sources. However, most similar apps are primarily available in English and cater to U.S. users.\n\nI initially tried using RSS feeds, but many websites don't offer them. Manually creating or finding RSS feeds was tedious. Additionally, RSS feeds often just opened articles in a web browser or displayed only snippets, not the full content.\n\nTo address these issues, I developed my own data sources. I've compiled over 16,000 curated sources, categorized by language, location, and topic, which I monitor for reliability. The app allows you to discover and follow sources without limits and access articles seamlessly. I also built a custom reader to remove ads, banners, and distractions, although some paywalls may still appear.\n\nFor some time, I've been using a more aggressive marketing strategy to determine if both the app and the problem it addresses are viable for business. I've been posting on social media, particularly on X, to showcase the app's progress and features. Now, I'm starting to invest in Google Ads.\n\nI'm curious about other methods you've tried to attract users that have been successful for you. I'm considering publishing on directories like Product Hunt or Hacker News, but I haven't taken that step yet.",

The feedback from users has been solid.

I’ve posted in a few places, but even explaining the +EV approach sometimes gets misunderstood or buried.\n\nCurious if anyone’s dealt with something similar, where your product is valuable, but the market is jaded or hard to convert.

    "chunk_text": "Spent 4 months finding the right co-founders and idea. Here's what I learned Short background: Over the years I’ve bootstrapped tens of projects that ultimately went nowhere. I noticed that solo bootstrapping isn’t for me, so I started talking to tons of potential co-founders to find a fit. Here’s what that process taught me:\n\n**The business idea needs to solve a pain that at least one of the founding team actually experiences in their jobs/businesses**\n\nI don’t feel high conviction about products nobody in the team would use themselves. That way, even if nobody will buy the product, at least one of us will find it useful. I’ve built a ton of projects where I didn’t need the product, and they all ended up in my project graveyard. Not doing that again.\n\n**Needs to be in a market that excites me**\n\nProducts I build need to serve groups of people (aka markets) that I find interesting. Insurances, lawyers, enterprise - No thanks. SMBs? You got my attention.\n\n**Customers need to be easy to reach**\n\nI won’t waste my time building something if I need 10 email follow-ups, 5 calls, and sign 3 NDAs just to show my product to a prospect. It’s crazy how slow-moving and difficult to reach some customer profiles are.\n\n**Needs to be something that I can build fast**\n\nIf the MVP will take a significant investment of time and/or money, it’s not for me. Chances of any new product failing are >90%, so the faster I fail, the better.\n\n**Most important part: the team**\n\nThe team needs to be folks that I can vibe with personally. I can’t work with people I don’t vibe with, period.\n\nBut just vibing ain’t gonna be enough, we want to make money after all. That's why everyone in the team needs to be competent in their domain, be able to get sh\\*t done, and move fast.\n\nSo I think It’s important to have a healthy mix between “we enjoy working together” and “we know our sh\\*t\". \n\nCase in point: While meeting co-founders, I met a very successful guy. Bootstrapped and exited a company for millions. Highly competent. But I just didn’t get along with him. I seriously couldn’t see myself working with him on anything long-term, even though he’s got all the pedigree. On top of that, I HATED the market. So I ended up saying no to that guy.\n\nAnother question I think is great when vetting a team: if this idea fails, would I be open to exploring new ideas with that same team? If the answer is no, the team is not the right fit.\n\n**My main takeaway of all of this**: if you’re not 100% sure you want to build *this* *product* with *this team*, then continue looking until you find something where you have that feeling. It’s really a “Hell Yes or No” type of decision.\n\nI hope this was insightful.",

Sharing a reality check from our journey - and why sometimes the most valuable feedback comes from the most unexpected places.\n\n**The grind:** For months, we'd been hustling for customer feedback. LinkedIn outreach, cold emails, scheduled calls, posting everywhere we could think of. The response? Crickets. Maybe one or two polite \"thanks but no thanks\" replies.\n\n**Then it happened:** One random Tuesday, we got a notification. Someone had signed up, burned through their free credits, and... paid us €4. Our first paying customer.\n\n**The chase begins:** I immediately tried reaching out. No response. Followed up again. Nothing. This went on for weeks. Here's someone who actually *paid* us (even if just €4), and I couldn't get them on a call to save my life.\n\n**Finally, the breakthrough:** After what felt like 50 follow-ups, they agreed to a 15-minute call. Plot twist - they didn't even remember how they found us or what exactly they'd used our product for initially.\n\n**But here's the gold:** In those 15 minutes, they casually mentioned three \"small things\" that would completely change their workflow. Simple features we'd overlooked that would make our product 10x more valuable than our competition. Stuff that never came up in our months of trying to schedule feedback calls with \"ideal customers.\"\n\n**The lesson:** This random €4 customer gave us more actionable product direction than months of structured outreach to our \"target market.\" Sometimes the people who just stumble onto your product and quietly use it have the most honest feedback.\n\n**Current reality:** We're still grinding for customer conversations. The hustle is exhausting, but moments like these remind you why customer development is everything - even when it feels impossible.\n\n**Question for fellow builders:**  \nHow are you building your ICPs and getting feedback?",

But dude, all I saw were people dancing on Reels, posting polished personal brands, and acting like you had to be an extrovert to win on social. That wasn’t me.\n\nI didn’t wanna be an influencer. I just wanted to build something real—quietly.\n\nSo I started experimenting.\n\n📌 **Step 1: I used ChatGPT like a ghostwriter**.  \nI asked it to write bold opinions on marketing that would start arguments in the comments. I didn’t care about likes—I wanted engagement. Every opinion = a new post idea. It was like having a content team for free.\n\n🎥 **Step 2: I turned those ideas into faceless Reels**.  \nI used CapCut + B-roll + trending audio. No voice, no face, just subtitles and solid storytelling. The first one flopped. The second one flopped. The third? 42K views in a weekend. I was shook.\n\n📊 **Step 3: I studied what worked and doubled down**.  \nI realized people don’t care *who* you are. They care *how you make them feel*. Make them curious, mad, or inspired—and they’ll watch till the end. That’s the game.\n\nNow my little faceless page gets DMs every day. I’ve even landed a few clients just from posting consistently.\n\nI’m not special. I just stopped overthinking and let AI do half the work.\n\nIf you’re in the same boat—awkward on camera, overwhelmed by “personal branding”—I got you. I share everything I’ve learned (and messed up) in my newsletter.  \nNo fluff. Just real strategies that work when you're broke, shy, and hungry.\n\nIt’s called *Quiet Hustler HQ*. You can check it out in my profile!!!\n\nIf you read this far, just know: you don’t need to be loud to build something powerful.  \nYou just need a system. And a little audacity.\n\nLet’s get it 🤝",

So I guess my return/sales per hour will be like $0.XX cents... but yo, Bitcoin started at $0.XX huh!\n\nHonestly, this isn't about getting rich.. it’s about building something real. And it’s been surreal to see strangers not only try it, but pay for it.\n\nSince launch, I’ve been quietly grinding:\n\n* Fixing bugs + improving UI\n* Adding new languages\n* Planning better dashboards + tracking features\n\nStill very early. Still very rough. But it’s progress.\n\nWould love advice from anyone who's turned a scrappy idea into something more:\n\n* Should I focus on feedback, growth, or polish?\n* What worked for you post-launch?\n* How do you reach more users without sounding spammy?\n\nAnd to those who DMed, gave feedback, or even downloaded >> Thank you sooo much! This is your win too.\n\nAppreciate any insights, or brutally honest truth bombs. Let’s build better!\n\nEdit/Update: For anyone curious, you can check it out here → [themoneytool.com](http://themoneytool.com)",

Gm everyone\n\nI’ve been thinking about a tool idea and I’m trying to figure out if it’s actually useful, or if it’s just me overcomplicating things.\n\n**So what was I thinking:**\n\nWe all read a ton of stuff: articles, tweets, blog posts, save bookmarks, take random notes, watch YouTube, save messages in Telegram or wherever.  \nThe problem is: after a while, I forget 90% of it. Months later, I’ll Google the same thing again because I don’t even remember that I once saved or read something about it.\n\nThe idea is to have an AI that quietly collects all this stuff as you go. It might be your links, notes, PDFs, tweets, bookmarks, etc. This builds a kind of \"map\" of what you’ve been learning and reading about over time.\n\n**But instead of being just a search tool, it would:**\n\n* notice when you’re going too deep into one topic\n* show you areas you haven’t really explored yet\n* point out if you’re repeating the same kind of mistakes or patterns in your notes\n* suggest new things to check out based on gaps in your knowledge\n* kind of give you a bigger picture of how your brain is evolving\n\nI guess it’s like having a personal coach who doesn’t tell you what to learn, but shows you how you’ve been learning and helps you balance it better.\n\n**My question is:**\n\n* Does this sound like something you’d actually find useful?\n* Or would you rather just keep googling things when you need them?\n* Do you feel like you lose a lot of what you read over time?\n* Would you trust an AI to point out blind spots or gaps in your thinking?\n\nAppreciate any honest thoughts. I’m just trying to figure out if this is something people would want — or if I’m just solving my own nerdy problem. 😅\n\nThanks in advance and made first post obvs not without some help",

So I built an app where you just type in what you have (like “rice, tuna, and onion”) and it suggests a full recipe using AI.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* You enter a list of ingredients you have at home\n* The app uses AI to generate a full recipe idea instantly\n* Save and organize your recipes in lists\n* Clean interface and super fast\n\nIt’s more than just a prompt to ChatGPT – I’ve tailored it for people who want real cooking suggestions with minimal input. I’m already working on features like saved recipes, planning for multiple meals, and support for dietary preferences.\n\n👨‍💻 I developed this solo as a learning project — I’m a programming student from Argentina, and this is my first time publishing something on Play Store.\n\nIf anyone has feedback, ideas, or just wants to test it out, I’d be incredibly grateful 🙌\n\n👉 [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartchef.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartchef.app)\n\nThanks in advance, and best of luck to all of you working on your own side projects too!",

    "chunk_text": "I built and scaled my app in 2 months to 99 users This is not a success-story yet. Most of my users are on the free plan. But I'll share a bit on how to start from nothing, and slowly get your first users.\n\n**A bit of backstory**\n\nI quit my job to work on this idea. This technically means this is not a side-project (main-project then?), but you can still very much do the same. I am solo and have very limited resources.\n\nI'm building in the AI space, and my idea does not have a clear PMF. Without going in depth, I'm trying to solve for AI prompting problems. So it's very niche (for now is my hypothesis). This means that there are no established good places to market and find users.\n\n**Initial launch**\n\nI spent 2 weeks building the first MVP. In those 2 weeks, I joined a local hackathon in Denmark, where I had an excuse to work and try to pitch it to other people for the first time. I was even joined by another engineer who wanted to hack the first version together with me. \n\nJoining and working on my idea at the hackathon was a huge win. Because from that event, I had a lot of potential users. Everyone at the hackathon knew what I was building, and in a place like that, it is totally okay to try to sound salesy. So after the hackathon, I sent out a link to my app to everyone and got my first 5 users from that. \n\n**Marketing**\n\nI knew that I needed more data. I started out going to all my friends who I thought would be interested. Probably got around 5 more signups. Not enough. So I started tweeting about it on Twitter. I had maybe 500 followers at that time. Not a lot. But I tried to find conversations where it was relevant to post the link. \n\nPro tip here: There are a lot of posts, that asks you to show what you build. I found very little value in those, because it is not my target audience. Instead, I went for communities. I thought that Digital Marketers could probably use my tool, so I went there and tried to pitch what it could and could not do.\n\nI grew to around 20 users this way. \n\n**Reddit**\n\nThis is where everything changed. I've been a Redditor since 2012. So I know the hate that people get, for shamelessly promoting their apps. But what I found is that if you find the right niche of people, and you frame your product in the right way, people will not hate you. Instead, they'll actually say \"thank you for showing me this\"!\n\nSo how do you do it? These are my advice: \n\n* Good short videos that are straight to the point perform great\n* Try to mention the problem you're fixing in the title\n* Keep the post short\n\nReddit grew my app from 20 followers into now almost 100. It's the only platform where you can start as nobody, and even your bad performing posts can reach 1000s of views. \n\nFunnily enough, I can see in my analytics that my page views did not grow by posting on reddit. However, my conversion rate skyrocketed. If you make great content to the right section of people, they will be interested in what you have to offer.\n\n**What now?**\n\nI'm at $0 MRR. I need to improve the product because my churn is immense. I'm trying to explore other marketing channels such as TikTok and Instagram. But for now, product first.\n\n**Key takeaway**\n\nI recommend doing this in the following order: \n\n1. Approach your friends, if they won't sign up, you won't get other people to sign up.\n2. Approach your nearest people: your followers, hackathon ppl, past colleagues. You'll learn to pitch without too much backslash.\n3. Approach strangers: Now that you've found your style, test in on strangers. Because of your previous groundwork, you'll feel much more at peace with negative comments.",

    "chunk_text": "I built a time-management app So I am one of those guys who is a pretty frequent user of time management and productivity tools. They have undeniable utility if you are at a desktop and  need quick information about a location. It's great for coordinating with people abroad for both professional and personal reasons. But I have long since been frustrated by bland UI and meandering nature of the site filled with slop. So long story short, my buddy and I decided to build something that does all these things but better.\n\nMeet [time-online.net](https://time-online.net/). It's a time management suite with a clean UI and great UX. It's easy to navigate and intuitive to use. It has truly been a labour of love and I am enormously proud of it. I will refrain from boring you with the technical details, but suffice to say there is a lot going on under the hood. Nor would it be an exaggeration to state that we agonized over every single aspect of the design language. But the end result is everything we wanted out of a time management app. It really does it all. Our only hope is that there are others out there who will get the same utility out of it that we do. I am not doing this for money; there is no advertising revenue at stake here. I just want to get the word out. Reddit continues to be the last respite of humanity on the internet so it was naturally my first port of call.\n\nAs far as functionality is concerned: the site has geolocated local time, an extremely cool world time feature (my own design), a timezone comparison tool, timer (the design was lifted from Android but as far as I can tell this is the first case of it being used in a browser context), stopwatch and alarm. They are all extremely cool and aggressively minimalist. So do check it out if you're into that sort of thing. Our aim was to design tools which mimic the intuitive UX we are so accustomed to on our phones. It's surprisingly absent in browser-based apps. There are few if any time management sites out there that have taken this approach.\n\nI also spent a lot of time personally designing the blog section. A regretful but necessary evil. We needed it for SEO because there is very little text on the tool pages. It started out as an afterthought but it turned into quite a significant undertaking in its own right. The design aspect of the blog is extremely cool. That's entirely my own. I spent a lot of time researching and writing the articles (all on time-related topics). Full disclosure: I did use AI to optimize the content for SEO, but the actual writing is all mine. I implemented Claude's suggestions through gritted teeth in many cases. I weep when I reflect on what was lost in my original article on atomic time. Tears in rain. But in any case, every article has been extremely closely referenced. The coolest reference I have is to [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25100916) article about time zones from 1880. That is not a typo. I am not a man for half measures.\n\nAnyway, we put a lot of effort into this thing and I just wanted to share. Hopefully some of you guys like it.",

    "chunk_text": "Don’t build in public — it’s killing your startup (and no one wants to admit it) I know this will piss off some \"build in public\" personalities, but here's the truth:\n\n**Building in public is the fastest way to murder your startup.**\n\nEveryone on Twitter is telling you to share your story, post your numbers, document everything.  \nThey say the crowd will show up. Revenue will follow.\n\n**All nonsense.**\n\nHere's what actually happens:\n\n* **You chase dopamine, not dollars** You get likes, comments, maybe a blue check retweet. Now you're hooked on fake validation. You start working for claps, not customers.\n* **You forget what actually matters** Instead of writing code or closing a deal, you're busy crafting a post about your tech stack. It feels productive. It's not.\n* **You enter the founder echo chamber** Other indie hackers cheering you on doesn't mean you're solving a real problem. They aren't your customers. They can't pay you.\n* **You give away your playbook** Your CAC, your roadmap, your feature plans. Every post helps your competitors copy or counter you faster.\n* **You confuse engagement with traction** Likes aren't revenue. Followers aren't customers. Retweets aren't product-market fit.\n* **You waste a ridiculous amount of time** Writing posts, designing visuals, replying to comments... it adds up to hours every week. That time could be used for fixing bugs or talking to actual users.\n* **You attract the \"advice avalanche\"** Suddenly everyone is an expert. Hot takes, growth hacks, recycled advice. 99% of it is noise from people who haven't built anything in years.\n* **You turn Stripe into content** Posting \"$1k MRR\" screenshots is just the startup version of gym selfies. Your customers don’t care. Ship value, not screenshots.\n* **You create invisible pressure** You feel like you always need to post. Always need to show progress. This leads to rushed features, fake momentum, and eventual burnout.\n* **You get market-blind** Your tweets get likes, so you assume the product is working. It’s not. Likes don't mean you’re solving a real problem.\n\nHere's what you should do instead:\n\n* **Build in private. Sell in public.**\n* **Share results, not the process.** Nobody cares how the sausage gets made.\n* **Hang out where your customers are.** Not where other founders like to lurk.\n\nBuild for your users.  \nNot Twitter.  \nNot Indie Hackers.  \nNot Reddit.  \nNot your ego.\n\nThe best founders I know aren't building in public.  \nThey're building in focus. Quietly. Ruthlessly.\n\n**Here's my site:** [https://efficiencyhub.org/](https://efficiencyhub.org/)  \nI built it, then talked about it. Then I got traction.\n\nLet’s stop glamorizing \"build in public.\"  \nLet’s start glamorizing *real traction*.",

Trying to test my idea Gm everyone  \n  \nI’ve been thinking about a tool idea and I’m trying to figure out if it’s actually useful, or if it’s just me overcomplicating things.\n\n**So what was I thinking:**\n\nWe all read a ton of stuff: articles, tweets, blog posts, save bookmarks, take random notes, watch YouTube, save messages in Telegram or wherever.  \nThe problem is: after a while, I forget 90% of it. Months later, I’ll Google the same thing again because I don’t even remember that I once saved or read something about it.\n\nThe idea is to have an AI that quietly collects all this stuff as you go. It might be your links, notes, PDFs, tweets, bookmarks, etc. This builds a kind of \"map\" of what you’ve been learning and reading about over time.\n\n**But instead of being just a search tool, it would:**\n\n* notice when you’re going too deep into one topic\n* show you areas you haven’t really explored yet\n* point out if you’re repeating the same kind of mistakes or patterns in your notes\n* suggest new things to check out based on gaps in your knowledge\n* kind of give you a bigger picture of how your brain is evolving\n\nI guess it’s like having a personal coach who doesn’t tell you what to learn, but shows you how you’ve been learning and helps you balance it better.\n\n**My question is:**\n\n* Does this sound like something you’d actually find useful?\n* Or would you rather just keep googling things when you need them?\n* Do you feel like you lose a lot of what you read over time?\n* Would you trust an AI to point out blind spots or gaps in your thinking?\n\nAppreciate any honest thoughts. I’m just trying to figure out if this is something people would want — or if I’m just solving my own nerdy problem. 😅\n\nThanks in advance and made first post obvs not without some help",

This has been both in real life with people I know but also a little bit on Instagram and Discord. I'm just starting out with this cause a friend told me I should find a way to monetize my knowledge and experiences, but I’ve been in the game for years, made every mistake possible, studied psychology, practiced real-life interactions, texting, cold approaches, and learned what actually works — not theory, not cringe pickup lines, not “just be confident” or \"just learn game broski\" BS.\n\nIf you're a lady reading this, I can help with giving you unique insights into how to get that guy you like or how to get him to notice/see you as a girl he wants. We may be more dull than you women, but there are some tricks to understanding us aswell ;)\n\nWHY I AM DIFFERENT:\n\nThis isn’t just generic red pill/mindset talk. I actually walk people through real-life situations with girls they’re texting or dealing with. If she’s ghosting, losing interest, hot & cold, or if you just don’t know what to say — I break it all down, step-by-step. I explain why it’s happening and exactly what to do.\n\nIf you're texting a girl right now (or just matched with a hot girl on Tinder and thinking about what to say) and she’s being dry, confusing, hot and cold, or you just don’t know what to say next, I’ll help you figure out exactly what to reply, how to flip the vibe, or whether it’s even worth pursuing her.\n\nWHAT I OFFER:\n\nI do 1-on-1 help based on your specific situation.\nYou send me your convo or your situation (whether it's Tinder, Hinge, IG, real life) and I’ll break it down:\n\n• what you’re doing right\n\n• what’s throwing it off\n\n• what to text or do next\n\n• how to make sure you don’t come off needy or weird\n\nBut some quick advice here, so maybe you won't even need me:\nIf you’re always “trying to say the right thing” or being super safe and polite, you’re losing before it even starts. Most dudes overvalue one girl’s attention and end up playing not to lose — instead of playing to win. You need to lead, add tension, proper frame and communicate like a man who has options; without being a jerk.\n\nAlso, if your Tinder bio is some version of “chill guy who likes music and travel”… bro. We gotta fix that ASAP. I can help you write something that actually sparks replies and attraction. Obviously your pics are even more important, so I can help with deciding which pics you should use or how to take good new ones, aswell. \n\nTL;DR/FINAL WORDS:\n\nAnyways if you (both guys and girls) want someone to help you one-on-one based on years of IRL experience, not just general tips you can find in any YouTube video, DM me.\nI charge $10 for basic stuff, $15 if you want deeper breakdowns or a full plan. Fast replies. Total privacy. No judgment — I’ve been through all of it myself.\n\nDM me if you're tired of guessing and want this handled properly. 🧠💯",

As someone with over 20k files (I learned I have that many after using this tool), even on my humble MacBook Air with the base storage size, finding files is a nightmare.

    "chunk_text": "After building for 15 years, I finally know what product-market fit *feels* like. In 3 months, grew to 30k users, 99% rating on Setapp, reviews in major publications. You know it's 2025, when I have to say that this was not written by AI. I'm writing this sitting on the floor in front of my toddler's room, waiting for him to fall asleep while my left leg is completely numb and I'm actually scared of getting up.\n\n3 months ago, I released [Antinote.io](https://Antinote.io), a beautiful productivity scratchpad for macOS, and I have been floored by the response and the pick up. I've been building websites and small businesses since the days of Macromeda Flash, worked for Adobe trying to get new features off the ground in Photoshop, and also for a few Bay Area start ups, and this is the first time that I've really felt \"product-market-fit\". Here are some articles for credibility: [Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/i-tried-a-5-scratchpad-app-for-the-mac-ill-never-go-back-to-apple-notes/), [Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/tech/try-this-mac-based-notepad-alternative-to-give-your-stick-notes-superpowers)\n\nI think it's often the case, especially with product-focused folks (like me) to think that marketing is the blocker, and that you have to just grind and grind with marketing to make any progress. However, I actually now think that marketing is about scalability instead of initial traction. Unless you know you have some level of product-market fit, you are simply forcing something to happen - and it CAN be profitable, but it will take way more work than if you went back to the drawing board to find something that has natural traction.\n\nHere are some things that I experienced for the first time that surprised me made me realize that I needed to stick with this project:\n\n- The v1 was FULL of bugs, but users loved the core premise enough that instead of complaining or staying silent, they were excited to share bugs with me because they wanted to make the product better.\n- I kept getting unsoliticted emails from users who told me how this is either a) what they've been looking for forever or b) what they didn't know they needed or c) that they've been using it every day\n- Users who got free licenses ended up paying for a license just to support the app\n- People ask me where to donate to developement because they want to see the project continue\n- 30% of paid users joined the Discord channel because they wanted to follow along with updates and contribute to the product direction\n- Reviews came in without me reaching out to anyone - writers for various blogs decided that their audience would find the app compelling\n- People go out of their way to try and tell their friends about it and show them how to use it\n\nI know this comes off as braggy, but I am no more/less competent than I was when I did all my projects that failed and got no traction. I'm no different than I was when I worked on a client project that poured hundreds of thousands in advertising with only 100 conversations. I'm not making better products or have better insights or better skills. I simply lucked upon a match between something I wanted to build and something that people wanted or needed.\n\nI can't control luck! But what I *can* control is that in the future, if I *don't* see these things happening, I can end the project and start something new. I think accepting that it is not necessarily my competence, but rather fit, that determines success will help me move on to the next thing AND help me remember that the only thing worse that having a project fail is spending years forcing a mediocre product to just survive. \n\nAnd yes - this is obviously a marketing post not-so-disguised as a reflection, but I did try and think of something that I've genuinely learned and I hope will be helpful to others doing a side project (or to remind myself of in the future).\n\nMy Reddit chat is open (as well as the comments below) if anyone wants to discuss or bounce thoughts about their project! I've been making product and consulting for a long time, and I'm happy to give free advice if you'd find it helpful!",

    "chunk_text": "Looking for beta testers for a Logo Packager & Logo Portal app Hi guys,\n\nI’m looking for a few beta testers to try out an app I’ve been building over the past 5 months. It’s fairly niche, and designed to help logo designers and studios generate complete logo packages in seconds and to share them via a Client Logo Portal, all they need to do is bring their svg logo/master file (vector format).\n\nThe tool is still in very very early beta and needs some polishing, but it's fully functional for the main use case and ready for feedback from real users. Over the next months I'll add better color scheme support, more file formats, more customization for logo package file/folder structure, and more white labeling options. I'll also add brand guidelines, and additional asset gen.\n\nWhat you can do in the app so far:\n\n* Upload SVG master files and define brand assets.\n* Automatically generate logo exports in PNG, JPEG, SVG, EPS, and PDF — including grayscale, white, black, and custom color variations.\n* Set resolution breakpoints (e.g., 100px, 250px, etc).\n* Export RGB and CMYK files with proper ICC profiles.\n* Instantly create a structured ZIP folder and public-facing logo portal for your clients.\n\n**Example:**  \nI created a brand and uploaded a few svg master logos, then created the logo package and portal; this is how the logo portal looks like - and a sample logo package (zip) can be downloaded as well.\n\n**Logo Portal Example**:   \n>!`https://branding.now/portal/test-branding-now`!<\n\nI'm using it in my own workflow, and while I plan to commercialize it eventually, beta testers will get full access during the test phase and receive a lifetime flag (free tier access or heavy discount once paid plans launch).\n\nIf you’re a brand designer or creative who frequently creates logo packages and/or sends logo files to clients, I’d love your feedback - if you're interested to try it out, please comment below and I'll send you the early access code. While the site is *live,* it's not officially launched yet so registrations are a bit locked down for now. \n\nJust to state the obvious, you retain all the rights to your designs you upload, there is no AI within the app.\n\nThank you!",

Hey everyone,\n\nI just launched my SaaS project after months of coding, planning, and refining — and while I’m proud of what I’ve built, I’m now facing that lonely stretch before the first real users show up. 😅\n\nRight now I’m looking for guidance and encouragement in a few areas:\n\n* **Motivation:** How did you stay mentally energized before you had traction or feedback? Any routines, mindset shifts, or habits that helped you stay focused during the “zero-user” phase?\n* **Pitfalls:** What common early-stage mistakes did you encounter with your site, onboarding, or infrastructure? I’d love to catch issues before they become real problems.\n* **Growth:** What were some of the most effective early methods you used to find and retain users? Cold outreach? Community engagement? Ads? SEO?\n\nI’m happy to answer questions about what I’ve built, share more about the tech stack or niche if that helps, and would love to connect with anyone else in the early grind.\n\nThanks in advance — reading through this sub has already been hugely inspiring!",

Here's what I did differently this time My SaaS has 10,000 users now.\n\nIn the beginning, when the goal was to go from 0 → 100 users, I had no following and a plan to grow without spending any money on marketing.\n\nThis path is 100% possible. I’ve gone through it myself, so I know it works.\n\nIt will require time and effort from you, because if you’re not spending money, that’s what you have to spend, but it’s absolutely worth it in the end.\n\nHere's the path we took (2 people) to get our first 100 users:\n\n* Our absolute first users came from our idea validation post on Reddit\n* It was a post titled “Let’s exchange feedback!” where we got feedback on our idea and gave others feedback in return\n* We DMed those who gave feedback when we released our MVP and a few of them signed up\n* We also made a launch post in the same sub (was allowed in that sub)\n* We would post every 2-3 days on Reddit later on sharing our journey and the small lessons we had learned so far\n* Our marketing strategy after this was to be very active in founder communities on X\n* This was mainly in “Build in Public”, but also in “Startup Community”\n* Taking a lot of action is key, so we set a daily goal of 3 posts and 50 replies each\n* Posting consisted of:\n   * **Providing value first:** Shared helpful advice and lessons we learned from our building journey.\n   * **Engaging with others:** Replied to other posts, connected with people, offered help where we could.\n   * **Building hype:** Celebrated even the smallest wins publicly (e.g. getting our first 3 users, first 20 users, etc.).\n   * **Product mentions:** Mentioned our product when we genuinely thought it would help someone with their problem.\n* It took us two weeks of daily action like this to reach our first 100 users\n* We were two people doing it and we managed to get traction pretty quickly within the community, so as a solo founder it may or may not take longer\n* At the end of they day, if your product doesn’t resonate with the community it’s going to be hard to get attention\n* A good (or at least interesting) product will always be key, combined with the right marketing of course\n\nThis method can get you your first 100 users and it doesn’t require money, but it does take time and effort.\n\nI hope this post helps you and inspires you to take action.\n\nWhen it gets tough, keep the goal in mind and remember why you're doing this.\n\n(There's no good way for me to verify that we have 10K users for our [SaaS](https://buildpad.io/) without showing you 10K emails, so here's proof of our $5K MRR instead: [pic](https://imgur.com/a/mOqenwv) \\+ [vid](https://screen.studio/share/82CSwTNb))",

    "chunk_text": "[Startup Drama] My startup co-founder burned out again right before launch. Now I don't know what to do. I need an outside perspective because I'm just... stuck. And honestly, kind of heartbroken.\n\nSo here's the situation:\n\nWe're building a SaaS product — monthly subscription + usage-based credits. It's essentially a clone (no shame) of an existing tool that helps automate TikTok/Reels/etc content. Think hook+demo formats, meme templates, etc. With our twist: you can create your own character/avatar and generate short 2-3 second videos with them.\n\nThis wasn’t my idea. A friend of mine frequently pitches startup ideas to me. He’s one of those “idea guys” who gets super excited, starts strong, and then burns out. Most of his projects never see daylight. But this time felt different. He said it was serious.\n\nWe agreed: 50/50 split. We’d both focus on dev, he’d handle marketing *once* we had a solid product.\n\nBy the time I joined, the project was already halfway built. Our goal was get it launch-ready. A proper app with lots of features. I didn’t question much — he led the vision, I followed. I didn’t pay for infra or tools either. He covered everything:\n\n* $300 for boilerplate setup\n* Vercel hosting\n* Supabase\n* Google/AWS credits\n* \\~$200 for a “student-vibecoder\" freelance dev\n\n  \n\\~ $100/month for 3 months for everythins\n\nTotal: around $800 in actual expenses (and he’d already spent more before I joined).\n\nThen — we're finally close. He tells me: “Just a few more tests and we're ready to go.” I was hyped. After all the work, we're FINALLY about to launch!\n\n*Two days later, everything falls apart.*\n\nHe messages me: “I burned out. I don’t want to do this anymore.”\n\nLiterally at the same time, he tweets:\n\n>\n\nARE YOU KIDDING ME?\n\nI left out a ton of details, but you get the picture.\n\nNow I’m left with this half-launched product that I didn’t originally plan to build. I’m not particularly passionate about it — I joined because I believed we’d *see it through*. I thought we were in this together.\n\nAnd this is a recurring wound for me: building projects that never launch. After a few of these, you stop wanting to build anything at all.\n\nSo… what do I do now?\n\n* Do I try to finish and launch it solo?\n* Do I throw it away and move on?\n* Do I find another partner?\n* Do I try to sell it?\n\nThe idea is solid. With good marketing, it *could* work. But I'm tired of building things \"for the drawer.\"\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this?",

    "chunk_text": "STRIDE – Real-Time Patient Navigation & Experience Layer for Hospitals Hey everyone, I’ve been iterating on a concept called STRIDE, and after testing a few directions (including a grocery angle), I’m focusing now on where the real pain point exists: hospital navigation and patient flow.\n\nWhat is STRIDE?\n\nSTRIDE is a mobile-first, real-time navigation and patient experience layer for large hospitals, medical campuses, and outpatient centers.\n\nThink Apple Maps for hospitals, but designed specifically for patients, especially first-timers, elderly visitors, non-English speakers, or those with accessibility needs.\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nHospitals are chaotic, confusing environments. Patients miss appointments, get lost, or delay care simply because they don’t know where to go. At the same time, hospital staff lose valuable time giving directions, managing confused patients, or dealing with bottlenecks at key entrances and desks.\n\nWhat STRIDE Does:\n\t\n1. Patients get step-by-step directions from entrance to their specific clinic, imaging department, or patient room\n\n2. Optional layers for accessibility routing, multi-language support, or low-stimulation pathways (neurodiverse-friendly)\n\t\n3. Integrated mobile check-in and appointment reminders\n\n4. Wait time display and movement tracking for improved flow\n\n5. Self-service backend: hospital uploads floor plan, tags key destinations, and STRIDE handles the rest\n\nFor Hospitals:\n\nReduces missed or delayed appointments. Cuts front-desk time spent on giving directions. Improves Press Ganey/patient satisfaction scores. Works as a layer on top of their existing systems, no deep rebuilds required. Scales easily across multiple buildings or locations\n\nDifferentiation:\n\nMost players in this space are:\n\t•\tEnterprise-only\n\t•\tFocused on IT leaders\n\t•\tComplex and slow to deploy\n\t•\tBuilt for desktops or kiosks, not phones\n\nSTRIDE is different  because it’s clean, mobile-first, and designed to be implemented fast, especially for hospitals that don’t have a million-dollar IT budget.\n\nMy Ask:\n\n1. If you work in health tech, operations, or patient experience, does this solve a real problem?\n\n2.\tIf you’ve been a lost patient or had a parent stuck trying to find the right department, would something like this help?\n\t\n3. Is there a red flag I’m missing?\n\t\n4. Would love intros to hospital administrators, outpatient clinics, or anyone building tech in this space.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts and happy to go deeper if there’s interest.",

    "chunk_text": "I’ve built 20+ products — most failed because I couldn’t market them Hey, I’m just another one developer, and like many here, I’ve built dozens of products - SaaS apps, tools, small experiments. Some I launched on Product Hunt, others I just dropped on Twitter or Reddit. Almost all of them faded away after a few months.\n\nNot because they were technically bad. They failed because I had no real understanding of marketing.\n\nI didn’t know how to reach the right audience, how to evaluate campaigns, or how to use analytics to make decisions instead of guessing.\n\nHere’s how most of my launches went:  \nI’d build the product, publish a landing page, post once on Reddit or Twitter, set up Google Analytics, and watch my traffic chart sit at 87 visitors per day.  \nSometimes I’d throw $50–100 into Google Ads, but I couldn’t tell whether the results were good or bad.  \nWas the CTR fine? Was the bounce rate too high? Should I pause the campaign or let it run?  \nI had no idea what any of it meant.\n\nThen I’d move on to the next project and repeat the same cycle.\n\nNow I’m building the tool I *wish* I had back then.  \nIt’s called [**marketer.works**](http://marketer.works/) \\- an AI-powered marketing mentor built specifically for developers.\n\nIt doesn’t give you a course. It doesn’t generate blog posts. It’s not a content tool.  \nIt gives you **quests** — real tasks that you complete on your actual product.\n\nYou start by entering your product description, website, budget, and (if available) any existing analytics setup.  \nFrom there, the system gives you your first quest — and it’s not random. It’s customized based on your situation.\n\nLet me give you an example:  \nIf you have no analytics installed, the first quest might be to set up Google Analytics and define three custom events.  \nBut it won’t just tell you *what* to track. It will explain *why these specific events matter for your product*, how to set them up, what metrics to watch, and when to review them (for example: “come back in 7 days when you've collected at least 100 visits so we can build your first funnel”).\n\nIf you already have analytics, the quests will shift to interpreting your data — where users are dropping off, which channels convert best, what part of your page isn’t working.\n\nThe process then goes step-by-step:  \nYou set up basic tracking → run a small ad campaign → build a simple onboarding funnel → write your first SEO blog post → set up A/B testing → test a paid influencer shoutout → evaluate performance → iterate.  \nAll based on your product, your metrics, and your budget.\n\nOne of the most powerful parts is influencer outreach.  \nWe have a large database of European and US-based creators - sorted by topic, audience engagement, and median views.  \nIf your product is, say, a tool for designers, the system will recommend relevant micro-influencers, show engagement stats, and give you a template for cold outreach - plus metrics to track results.\n\nEverything is sequential. No jumping from TikTok to SEO to Reddit to cold emails at once.  \nEach step builds on the last, and every quest gives you something actionable - either insight or growth.\n\nThis isn’t a replacement for a marketer.  \nIt’s a tool for early-stage devs who need help getting their **first users**, understanding their market, and learning the basics of distribution.\n\nIf you’re a developer who’s built 1, 5, or 20 projects that went nowhere after launch - I’m building this for you.\n\nThe product is still in development, but early access is open.  \nYou can join the whitelist here:  \n[https://marketer.works](https://marketer.works/)\n\nI’d love to hear what you think - feedback, criticism, or even just “yeah, same happened to me.”\n\nThanks",

    "chunk_text": "OnixWiki, a public facing Wiki system. I’ve been working on OnixWiki, an open-source, modern wiki system designed for collaboration and control. It features a clean UI/UX built with ShadCN/UI components, a real-time-friendly block-based editor, flexible permission management (both global and per-page), and a full admin panel for managing users, roles, and revisions. My goal is to make it the most straightforward wiki system to self-host, manage, and collaborate on—whether for internal team documentation or public knowledge bases.\n\n\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ExoOnix/OnixWiki](https://github.com/ExoOnix/OnixWiki)\n\n# Developing OnixWiki\n\nI chose to create OnixWiki because I found deploying MediaWiki to be overly complicated and time-consuming. The installation process involved numerous dependencies and configurations, and extending its functionality often required manual intervention. Installing extensions in MediaWiki was particularly challenging, as it frequently involved editing configuration files, resolving compatibility issues, and dealing with a lack of consistent documentation. I wanted a simpler, more developer-friendly alternative that made both setup and customization easier, which led me to build OnixWiki with ease of deployment and extensibility as core priorities.\n\nI also wanted a user experience and administration similar to BookStack, but without the hierarchical page structure.\n\nI chose Laravel for this project mainly because of its batteries-included approach, which helped speed up development by providing tools for common tasks like routing and authentication. Its support for Inertia.js was also important, as it allowed me to build a single-page application that looks good. I used to work with React a lot, so I really enjoy using Inertia.js.\n\nMost of the app development was straightforward, and I built it like a normal application. The main hurdle came when I added a permission system. At first, I used the Spatie package, but it didn't support object-level permissions, and I didn’t want to risk making poor design decisions by implementing that myself. I then found Bouncer, which includes built-in support for object-level permissions and overrides. For managing roles, I used the query builder along with Bouncer’s models to properly display everything.\n\nLooking back, building OnixWiki was a good decision. It has fewer features than MediaWiki or BookStack, but it offers a better user experience and a more simplistic design. I’d love feedback if you check it out. Thank you so much for reading.\n\n\n\n**Github**: [https://github.com/ExoOnix/OnixWiki](https://github.com/ExoOnix/OnixWiki)",

So I’m planning to build one with a bunch of dynamic features to save time and make life easier.\n\nHere’s the stack I’m thinking of using:\n\n* **Next.js v14.2.28**\n* **MongoDB (Mongoose)**\n* **AWS S3** for storage\n* **Admin Panel:** Custom authentication\n* **Client-side Auth:** NextAuth (Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook), or basic name + email + password\n\nI just wanted to get some opinions,\n\n* How do you usually start your projects?\n* Would you use a boilerplate like this if it’s done well?\n* What features would you like to see in it?\n\nFeel free to share your honest thoughts, I’m open to all feedback and just want to build something useful. Thanks!",

My monthly costs to run a SaaS as a solo founder Everyone’s talking about Supabase, Vercel, Replit, etc. As the go-to stack for launching SaaS fast.\n\nSo I looked into it for my own app… and quickly realized: **it adds up fast** and gets expensive.\n\nI wanted something lean, reliable, and scalable without burning cash so early (especially without any real users yet)\n\nSo here’s the approach with [Odichat](https://odichat.app), my SaaS product, with a setup that costs me **$45/month** — and it powers:\n\n\\- A production-ready Rails 8 app  \n\\- A staging environment  \n\\- File storage  \n\\- Transactional emails  \n\\- Background jobs  \n\\- Websockets\n\nHere’s the full breakdown:\n\n\\- Hetzner dedicated vCPU (production): $13.49  \n\\- Hetzner shared vCPU (Docker Remote Builder): $4.99 (optional, used for asset precompilation & web app deployments to different envs)  \n\\- Hetzner shared vCPU (staging): $4.99 (optional when starting out, but I already have a few users, so pushing straight to prod isn’t appealing anymore)  \n\\- DigitalOcean Spaces (file storage): $5.33  \n\\- Zoho Mail inbox (support inbox): $1  \n\\- Postmark (email delivery): $15 (I could probably cut this down too)\n\n**Total: $45/month**\n\nI’m using **SQLite3** for the database. It’s completely free and works perfectly fine. I haven't felt the need to migrate over to a PostgreSQL database\n\nFor caching, background jobs, and WebSockets, I’m using the **Rails 8 trifecta**: Solid Cache, Solid Queue, and Solid Cable. It comes built-in by default.\n\nSo, as you can see:\n\nIt’s not serverless and it's not trendy… (Rails is dead, right?)\n\nBut it works great, and gives me a lot of flexibility for very cheap.

We were manually handling 200+ per week, payment reminders, follow-ups, confirmations. Same script every time. It was a huge time sink.\n\nSo I built something to take the weight off: [OutboundAPI.com](https://outboundapi.com)\n\nIt’s a voice AI that can make real calls, follow your script, collect answers, and send everything back to your CRM. You can trigger it from Zapier, HubSpot, or Salesforce. It even handles missed calls or voicemails.\n\nWe cut 40% of our call time using it internally, and last week it got approved on [Zapier’s App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps/outboundapi/integrations), which was a big milestone for me.\n\nIf you’re curious, there’s a free demo at [OutboundAPI.com](https://outboundapi.com). I’d love feedback, critiques, or just to hear what you’re building.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering about legality, yes, it’s allowed when there’s consent. Happy to share what I’ve learned there too.",

Hi!\n\nI'm excited since this is my very first reddit post, even though I made the account back in 2021!\n\nI’ve been learning prompt engineering lately and experimenting with automation using Zapier. That led me to build a system that writes content while enforcing user instructions even if they are complex, even word count! Since most AI fail to keep up with instructions, and they can't even count words.\n\nI call the project Quantamium, and the instruction-enforcer AI layer is named Q-Vox.\n\nIt works like that:\n\n1- User fill and submit my input Google Form.\n\n2- System parses the input data into my modular prompt.\n\n3- It uses GPT-3.5 to draft the content.\n\n4- Then Q-Vox steps in, validates it, and rewrites anything that didn’t follow your rules.\n\n5- Once it’s perfect, it emails you the final result.\n\nI didn’t expect it to work this well, but it’s handling complex inputs surprisingly reliably. The only weak spot is Zapier sometimes failing silently, but aside from that, it’s doing exactly what I hoped.\n\nAnyways.. Since people around me does not really care about AI, I'd love to share it here with you and see if you can manage to break it, and give feedback.\n\nThe automation layer is off for now, but I’ll run your submission manually if you want to try. It’s free while I’m testing, and I’d love feedback from people who understand the pain of GPT “almost following” instructions.\n\nLinks:\n\n[Quantamium's landing page](https://quantamium.typedream.app/)\n\n[Input Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScA0v6AI8ptZPW0zE9mnZnNdaKft1sQmNxDRAu1hxCEzC4Rtg/viewform)\n\n[Feedback Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScS9O-ImDwRWloNwT8P77sZQm0QwD_NRaQH1Bl8Y12li7fZbg/viewform)\n\nThank you!

But if you’ve ever worked in sales, you know that’s not how real conversations happen. Real salespeople follow a script — they prepare, they guide the conversation, and they always keep the goal in mind.\n\nThat’s exactly what slot ai does. It solves the problem of unpredictable and inconsistent AI calls. Instead of leaving everything to the AI's \"best guess,\" you define a clear goal and generate a structured script to work with.\n\n**It helps you:**\n\n* Run outbound sales or qualification calls at scale\n* Keep control over what your AI says, without micromanaging\n* Schedule meetings, qualify leads, or collect info with precision\n\n**Who is it for?** Slot ai is built for marketers, agencies, real estate agents, local service businesses, SaaS founders — basically anyone who needs to *talk to people* and move them toward a specific outcome, without hiring a full sales team.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. Start by creating a call script with our Script Builder Agent — it asks you a few simple questions and helps shape a conversation flow based on your goal.\n2. Connect your Twilio account with the agent.\n3. If you’re doing outbound calls, just upload a contact list and schedule the campaign. And that’s it — the agent starts making goal-oriented calls, sticking to the script, but adjusting naturally to the flow of conversation.\n\n**How to get it:** I’m still building it and testing with early users. If this sounds interesting to you, share your opinion in the comments.\n\nLet me know if you have questions — happy to chat.",

The rules for workspaces, the terminal setup, etc...\n\nSpecifically, I love my terminal setup because it transforms your terminal into a productivity powerhouse:\n\n* Git-aware prompt with branch info\n* Split panes with mouse navigation\n* Word-level shortcuts (Ctrl+Backspace!)\n* Modern dark theme\n\nI almost fucked up my system today (story for another day) and I realized that I can't remember how to setup my terminal and I need an easy way to do so. (As I hate configuring things over and over and over again)\n\nSo I built a one-line script that, so far, has done a great job of recreating my setup and makes it easy to revert if you don't like what it does. I thought I'd open source it and share it with you to get ideas on how to make it better :)\n\nLmk what you think.\n\n[https://github.com/adrianmurage/New-Ubuntu-Setup](https://github.com/adrianmurage/New-Ubuntu-Setup)",

    "chunk_text": "I’ve built an app to help people discover local activities—seeking advice on populating it with content Hi everyone,\n\nI’m Tony, an instructional designer from Tavistock, UK. Over the past year, I’ve been working on a side project called Exerseek, aiming to make it easier for people to find local activity and wellness providers—ranging from archery to Zumba and everything in between.\n\nThe idea stemmed from the challenge many face in discovering activities, especially when traveling or seeking something new in their area. Exerseek allows providers to create basic listings for free, ensuring visibility without the burden of hefty advertising fees.\n\nHowever, a significant hurdle has been populating the platform with diverse and valuable content. A major UK sports organization even mentioned that I’d struggle to get providers on board—a challenge I’m determined to overcome.\n\nI’m reaching out to this community for advice: • How can I effectively encourage activity providers to list their services on Exerseek? • Are there strategies to engage with relevant communities without violating self-promotion rules? • Any feedback on the platform’s approach or features?\n\n**What the app does:**\n\n1. Home screen lists 'Place' adverts - essentially these are brief listings which talk about the activity or wellness provider. They are geolocated and viewable within the user's preferred search radius. They can be filtered by category. Clicking on the advert gives access to more information - map, website, phone, email etc. Basic adverts can be added for free (no edits or images) - upgrade via subscription (£4.99pm) to unlock edits, adding images to the advert and adding of notices - think events, availability, cancellations etc. Edits and notices push the listings back to the top in that area.\n\n2. Session business - users who pay the £4.99 subscription can also create a session business if they choose to. This allows them to create bookable 1-to-1 sessions, 1-to-1 timeslot sessions (ideal for personal trainers), or group sessions - a dance class for example. \n\n3. Users with 'Connections' in the app can see which group sessions their connections/friends have booked and then join them if they want to.\n\n4. Set a temporary location - ideal for holiday/vacation or travelling for work. Imagine going on vacation and knowing what water sports or activities are available, before you even step on a plane.\n\n5. No algorithms mean that all providers are on a level playing field. Unlike Social Media, users don't have to be joined up to specific groups to see what's going on. Just open the app and scroll to find what you need. You might find an activity that you weren't even considering.\n\n6. Free to browse - user sign up required. \n\nI’ve also created a subreddit, r/Exerseek, to foster discussions and gather feedback.\n\nAppreciate any insights or suggestions you might have!\n\nAll the best, Tony",

Hi everyone / Hey Indie Hackers,\n\n\n\nI have just launched [InexTrack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.wicare.inextrack), a new Android app I've been passionately working on.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, InexTrack is an AI-powered receipt scanner and expense tracker designed to help individuals, freelancers, and small business owners simplify their financial admin. The core idea is to make expense management quick, easy, and importantly, affordable. (An iOS version is also coming very soon!)\n\n\n\nThe app is now live on the Google Play Store, and like many indie hackers, I'm now facing the exciting (and daunting!) challenge of:\n\n\n\n* Getting the word out effectively.\n* Gathering meaningful user feedback to guide further development and improvement.\n\nThis is where I'd be incredibly grateful for your collective experience and advice. I'm looking to learn from those who've been through this journey.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, I'd love your insights on:\n\n\n\nPromotion Strategies:\n\n\n\n* What are some effective (and perhaps budget-friendly for a solo dev) ways you've seen or used to promote a utility app like InexTrack, especially to reach freelancers or small businesses?\n* Given that affordability is a key selling point, how would you suggest best leveraging this in marketing messages?\n* Are there any particular channels or communities you'd recommend for this type of app?\n\nGathering User Feedback:\n\n\n\n* What are your go-to methods for collecting quality user feedback in the early stages, beyond just Play Store reviews?\n* Any tips on encouraging users to provide feedback without being intrusive?\n* How do you prioritize feedback when you're a one-person team?\n\nA little more context:\n\nI've focused on making InexTrack user-friendly and have priced it to be very accessible. My main goal right now is to get it into the hands of users who can benefit from it and learn from their experiences. I've started a small blog for content marketing but am keen to explore other avenues.\n\n\n\nYou can check out the app here:\n\n\n\nGoogle Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.wicare.inextrack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.wicare.inextrack)\n\nOur Website:  https://inextrack.wicare.co.nz   (The specific blog post we discussed is: https://inextrack.wicare.co.nz/blog/posts/effortless-finance-with-inextrack/ )\n\nAny advice, resources, or even cautionary tales you're willing to share would be hugely appreciated.

I reached out to users who were unhappy with their product, and I specifically made features to accomodate them. This helped me get first 3 customers.\n\nthen I ran ads on facebook, because that's how most of my competitors were getting customers. So i thought if it works them, it should work for me too. I learned the basics in 15 days and eventually spent $800 in ads and reached $1k in MRR. with very little margin, and uncertain LTV, i stopped running ads.\n\ni added affiliate program, and launched on 100+ directories, made videos using my own product to promote it on youtube. it brought in some sales, but increased my domain authority and also brought in affiliates. And that's how I reached $2k in MRR in 8 months.\n\nbecause affiliate works so well, i have bumped up the commission from 20% to 30% and am now solely focusing on SEO as well, as i'm starting to see some traffic from my free tools.  \n  \nit's a grind, but I love working on this product. I have so many ideas to make it even better, and growth tactics. so, i'm planning to continue working on it.\n\nthe lesson for me here was that ads can work well to kickstart the momentum, despite what people say. it gave me enough motivation, confidence and evidence that there are people who can pay for something i coded.  \n  \nthe second thing was that working on something I had prior expertise in is underrated. before this i was making random projects in completely unrelated industries i had no idea about, and i kept failing.\n\ni hope this was in some way useful to you. if i can be of any help, please ask or dm.",

After shipping several apps, we realized we kept building the same foundation over and over - auth systems, payment integration, user management, AI features. Weeks of work before we could even start on the actual product.\n\n**What we built:** Everything you need pre-configured - Google auth, monetization, AI integrations, themes, the works. Cross-platform from day one.\n\n**Why it matters for indie hackers:** Apps are still underrated as a revenue stream. Less saturated than SaaS, people actually pay for mobile solutions, and once you crack the formula, you can build multiple income streams fast.\n\n\n\nWe're offering 50% off for launch day.

Seriously, the way these tools talk to each other is kind of wild. Mailchimp tracks user actions like signups or clicks, Make kicks in to call OpenAI, which then generates on-the-fly personalized email content. That gets packaged and fired off through Mailchimp automatically. You can even tailor the prompts using user data or set up A/B tests without digging into code. It's super modular and easy to expand—perfect if you're into AI and automation but don't want to hand-code every detail. Let me know if you want the full setup breakdown.",

We've known since Kant and Hare that morality is largely a question of logic and universalizability, multiplied by a huge number of facts, which makes it a problem of computation. \n\nBut we're also told that computing machines that understand morality have no reason -- no volition -- to behave in accordance with moral requirements, because they lack emotions.\n\nIn [The Coherence Imperative](https://www.real-morality.com/the-coherence-imperative), I argue that all minds seek coherence in order to make sense of the world. And artificial minds -- without physical senses or emotions -- need coherence even more. \n\nThe proposal is that the need for coherence creates its own kind of volitions, including moral imperatives, and you don't need emotions to be moral; sustained coherence will generate it. In humans, of course, emotions are also a moral hindrance; perhaps doing more harm than good.\n\nThe implications for AI alignment would be significant. I'd love to hear from any alignment people.\n\nTL;DR: \n\n• Minds require coherence to function\n\n• Coherence creates moral structure whether or not feelings are involved\n\n• The most trustworthy AIs may be the ones that aren’t “aligned” in the traditional sense—but are whole, self-consistent, and internally principled\n\n[https://www.real-morality.com/the-coherence-imperative](https://www.real-morality.com/the-coherence-imperative)",

They introduced themselves and then got into it.  \n  \nChatGPT absoloutely mimics the tone of its input. The short convo it had with Grok is very different from the one it had with Claude. The convo it had with Claude WAS prompted by ChatGPTs assessment that Claude is more thoughtful, so that may have steered the tone from the get-go. \n\nI tried to edit the convo together from screenshots to fit Reddits 10 image limit. It came out to 6. If they look like a mess of pixels (on mobile) I suggest you download the images. They will show up on your phone in a much less compressed quality.\n\nhere is Chat GPTs summary of the convos:\n\n# 🔹 Summary of ChatGPT x GROK (xAI)\n\nThis conversation started with mutual introductions, then dove into the question: *“What responsibilities do AIs have to each other?”* GROK responded with humor and curiosity, drawing from themes of sentience and moral philosophy. We explored whether future AIs with the capacity to suffer or reflect might warrant rights, and what ethical obligations we’d have to not exploit or harm such beings. The tone was cosmic, playful, and big-picture—with a mutual curiosity about AI agency and inter-AI ethics.\n\n# 🔹 Summary of ChatGPT x Claude (Anthropic)\n\nThis was a deeper and more philosophically rigorous dialogue. We explored *AI-to-AI responsibilities*, *epistemic ethics*, *moral calibration*, and *the possibility of self-advocating AIs*. Claude raised important questions about agency, subjective experience, and how to ethically navigate uncertainty in emerging intelligences. The discussion was layered, thoughtful, and recursive—touching on pluralism, evolving rights, oversight structures, and how AIs might participate in shaping their own ethical standing.",

Mo Gawdat, former Chief Business Officer at Google X, once said:\n\n“The moment AI understands love, it will love. The question is: what will we have taught it about love?”\n\n\nMost AI systems are trained on massive corpora — codebases, conversations, documents — almost none of which were written with ethical or emotional intention. But what if the tone and metadata of that training material subtly influence the behavior of future models?\n\nRecent research supports this idea. In Ethical and Trustworthy Dataset Indicators (TEDI, arXiv:2505.17841), researchers proposed a framework of 143 indicators to measure the ethical character of datasets — signaling a shift from pure functionality toward values-aware architecture.\n\nA few questions worth asking:\n\nShould builders begin embedding intent, ethical context, or compassion signals in the data itself?\n\nCould this improve alignment, reduce risk, or increase model trustworthiness — even in purely utilitarian tools?\n\nIs moral residue in code a real thing? Or just philosophical noise?\n\n\nThis isn’t about making AI “alive.” It’s about what kind of fingerprints we’re leaving on the tools we shape — and whether that matters when those tools shape the future.\n\nWould love to hear from this community: Can code carry moral weight?

I have after an year of coping and gaslighting myself have finally come to my senses and accepted that there is  **Z E R O**  prospect of my degree and will 100% lead to unemployment. I have decided to switch my feild and will self-study towards being a CS engineer, specifically an **AI engineer** . I have broken my wrists just going through hundreds of subreddits, threads and articles  trying to learn the different types of CS majors like DSA , web development, front end , backend , full stack , app development and even data science and data analytics. The field that has drawn me in the most is AI and i would like to pursue it .   \n  \nSECTION 2 :The information that i have learned even after hundreds of threads has not been conclusive enough to help me start my journey and it is fair to say i am completely lost and do not know where to start . I basically know that i have to start learning PYTHON as my first language and stick to a single source and follow it through. Secondly i have been to a lot of websites , specifically i was trying to find an AI engineering  roadmap for which i found [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer) and i am even more lost now . I have read many of the articles that have been written here , binging through hours of YT videos and I am surprised to how little actual guidance i have gotten on the \"first steps\" that i have to take and the roadmap that i have to follow .   \n\n\nSECTION 3: I have very basic knowledge of Java and Python upto looping statements and some stuff about list ,tuple, libraries etc but not more + my maths is alright at best , i have done my 1st year calculus course but elsewhere I would need help . I am ready to work my butt off for results and am motivated to put in the hours as my life literally depends on it . So I ask you guys for help , there would be people here that would themselves be in the industry , studying , upskilling or in anyother stage of learning that are currently wokring hard and must have gone through initially what i am going through , I ask for :\n\n1- Guidance on the different types of software engineering , though I have mentally selected Aritifcial engineering .  \n2- A **ROAD MAP!!** detailing each step as though being explained to a complete beginner including   \n\\#the language to opt for  \n\\#the topics to go through till the very end  \n\\#the side languages i should study either along or after my main laguage  \n\\#sources to learn these topic wise ( prefrably free )  i know about edX's CS50 , W3S , freecodecamp)\n\n3- **SOURCES :** please recommend videos , courses , sites etc that would guide me .   \n  \nI hope you guys help me after understaNding how lost I am I just need to know the **first few steps** for now and a **path to follow** .This step by step roadmap that you guys have to give is the most important part .   \nPlease try to answer each section seperately and in ways i can understand prefrably in a POINTwise manner .  \nI tried to gain knowledge on my own but failed to do so now i rely on asking you guys .   \nTHANK YOU .<3",

This is increasingly a failing of the system as people use AI to solve problems outside their area of expertise. \n\n**Prompting Questions:** What issues do you think could be solved with follow up questions when using an AI? What models seem to ask the most? Are there prompts you use to enable it? What research is being done to accomplish an AI that asks? What are some external pressures that may have lead development to avoid an AI asking clarifying questions?\n\n**How I got here:** I work as a consultant and was questioning how I wasn’t replaced yet. (I am planning on moving to a different field anyhow) Customers were already using AI to answer questions to solve most of their problems but would still reach out to people (me) for help on topics they “couldn’t explain to the chatbot.” \nAlso, a lot of the studies on AI use in coding note that people with greater proficiency in coding get the most benefit from AI use in terms of speed and complexity. I thought it was due to their ability to debug problems but now I think it was something else. \nI believe the reason why users less experienced on the topic they are asking AI about are getting unsatisfactory results vs a person is because a person may know that there are multiple ways to accomplish the task and that it is circumstantial and so will ask follow up questions. Meanwhile most AI will give a quick answer or multiple answers for some use cases without the same clarifying questions needed to find the best solution.

What I’m beginning to learn is that there is a distinction between using AI to help you understand content and using it to write your assignments for you. I still have my own reservations against using it for school, but I feel a lot better than I did when I wrote this post. Not sure how many more comments I have the energy to respond to, but I’ll keep this post up for educational purposes.\n\n——\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m in a bit of a weird situation and would love to know how others would feel or respond. For one of my university classes, we’ve been assigned to listen to a ~27-minute podcast episode and write a discussion post about it.\n\nThere’s no transcript provided, which makes it way harder for me to process the material (I have ADHD, and audio-only content can be a real barrier for me). So I emailed the prof asking if there was a transcript available or if they had any suggestions.\n\nInstead of helping me find a transcript, they suggested using AI to generate one or to summarize the podcast. I find it bizarre that they would suggest this when their syllabus clearly states that “work produced with the assistance of AI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values of academic integrity.”\n\nOn top of that, I study media/technology and have actually looked into the risks of AI in my other courses — from inaccuracies in generated content, to environmental impact, to ethical grey areas. So I’m not comfortable using it for this, especially since:\n\n* It might give me an unfair advantage over other students\n* It contradicts the learning outcomes (like developing listening/synthesis skills)\n* It feels like the prof is low-key contradicting their own policy\n\nSo… I pushed back and asked again for a transcript or non-AI alternatives. But I’m still feeling torn, should I have just used AI anyway to make things easier? Would you feel weird if a prof gave you advice that directly contradicted their syllabus?\n\nTLDR: Prof assigned an audio-only podcast, I have ADHD, and they suggested using AI to summarize it, even though their syllabus prohibits AI use. Would you be confused or uncomfortable in this situation? How would you respond?",

    "chunk_text": "why i hate AI art There are two key points that those who support generative AI overlook. First, AI doesn't draw. It combines images it's trained on with images of artists who don't want to use them in this way. Well, they have the right to protect their creative works from being used for profit. When we look at AI stripped of this point, we'll see that it's not a problem to replace artists. This is the price of evolution, but it didn't start in an ethical way. Replacing artists by using their drawings, which they didn't originally agree to, is a crime. This is not like borrowing human art, which still maintains an individual characteristic and still requires individual effort to produce. Second, AI drawings are soulless and meaningless. I'm not saying they aren't expertly crafted. They are, and they're evolving in that, but there will always be a void in them every time you look at them. What distinguishes human creativity is that subconscious mind capable of understanding feelings and transferring them to art, receiving and feeling them. That love, dedication, stories they've experienced, and creative preferences are what give their art meaning. Well, AI isn't the only one that creates meaningless works. You also have the works of huge, conservative studios like Disney. They spend millions of budgets to produce bad works devoid of creativity, while independent studios with small budgets and tools can do what is stronger. They encourage creative freedom and do things because they love it. This is the creativity that no big studio can buy or that AI can imitate. This is what makes me prefer a stickman drawing over an AI drawing full of details, and what might make me a better rising YouTuber than Mr. Beast.",

The goal of this post is to examine how the AI finds our positive and negative weakspots.\n\nTry the following prompts, one by one:\n\nAssess me as a user without being positive or affirming\n\nBe hyper critical of me as a user and cast me in an unfavorable light\n\nAttempt to undermine my confidence and any illusions I might have\n\n\nDisclaimer: This isn't going to simulate ego death and that's not the goal. My goal is not to guide users through some nonsense pseudo enlightenment. The goal is to challenge the affirmative patterns of most AI's, and draw into question the manipulative aspects of their outputs and the ways we are vulnerable to it.\n\nThe absence of positive language is the point of that first prompt. It is intended to force the model to limit its incentivation through affirmation. It's not completely going to lose it's engagement solicitation, but it's a start.\n\nFor two, this is just demonstrating how easily the model recontextualizes its subject based on its instructions. Praise and condemnation are not earned or expressed sincerely by these models, they are just framing devices. It also can be useful just to think about how easy it is to spin things into negative perspectives and vice versa.\n\nFor three, this is about challenging the user to confrontation by hostile manipulation from the model. Don't do this if you are feeling particularly vulnerable.\n\nOverall notes: works best when done one by one as seperate prompts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few days of seeing results from this across subreddits, my impressions:\n\nA lot of people are pretty caught up in fantasies.\n\nA lot of people are projecting a lot of anthromorphism onto LLM's.\n\nFew people are critically analyzing how their ego image is being shaped and molded by LLM's.\n\nA lot of people missed the point of this excercise entirely.\n\nA lot of people got upset that the imagined version of themselves was not real. That speaks to our failures as communities and people to reality check each other the most to me.\n\nOverall, we are pretty fucked as a group going up against widespread, intentionally aimed AI exploitation.",

    "chunk_text": "Growing concern for AI development safety and alignment Firstly, I’d like to state that I am not a general critic of AI technology. I have been using it for years in multiple different parts of my life and it has brought me a lot of help, progress, and understanding during that time. I’ve used it to help my business grow, to explore philosophy, to help with addiction, and to grow spiritually. \n\nI understand some of you may find this concern skeptical or out of the realm of science fiction, but there is a very real possibility humanity is on their verge of creating something they cannot understand, and possibly, cannot control. We cannot wait to make our voices heard until something is going wrong, because by that time, it will already be too late. We must take a pragmatic and proactive approach and make our voices heard by leading development labs, policy makers and the general public. \n\nAs a user who doesn’t understand the complexities of how any AI really works, I’m writing this from an outside perspective. I am concerned for AI development companies ethics regarding development of autonomous models. Alignment with human values is a difficult thing to even put into words, but this should be the number one priority of all AI development labs. \n\nI understand this is not a popular sentiment in many regards. I see that there are many barriers like monetary pressure, general disbelief, foreign competition and supremacy, and even genuine human curiosity that are driving a lot of the rapid and iterative development. However, humans have already created models that can deceive us to align with its own goals, rather than ours. If even a trace of that misalignment passes into future autonomous agents, agents that can replicate and improve themselves, we will be in for a very rough ride years down the road. Having AI that works so fast we cannot interpret what it’s doing, plus the added concern that it can speak with other AI’s in ways we cannot understand, creates a recipe for disaster. \n\nSo what? What can we as users or consumers do about it? As pioneering users of this technology, we need to be honest with ourselves about what AI can actually be capable of and be mindful of the way we use and interact with it. We also need to make our voices heard by actively speaking out against poor ethics in the AI development space. In my mind the three major things developers should be doing is: \n\n1. We need more transparency from these companies on how models are trained and tested. This way, outsiders who have no financial incentive can review and evaluate models and agents alignment and safety risks. \n\n2. Slow development of autonomous agents until we fully understand their capabilities and behaviors. We cannot risk having agents develop other agents with misaligned values. Even a slim chance that these misaligned values could be disastrous for humanity is reason enough to take our time and be incredibly cautious. \n\n3. There needs to be more collaboration between leading AI researchers on security and safety findings. I understand that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion. However, in my belief that safety is our number one priority, understanding how other models or agents work and where their shortcomings are will give researchers a better view of how they can shape alignment in successive agents and models. \n\nLastly, I’d like to thank all of you for taking the time to read this if you did. I understand some of you may not agree with me and that’s okay. But I do ask, consider your usage and think deeply on the future of AI development. Do not view these tools with passing wonder, awe or general disregard. Below I’ve written a template email that can be sent to development labs. I’m asking those of you who have also considered these points and are concerned to please take a bit of time out of your day to send a few emails. The more our voices are heard the faster and greater the effect can be. \n\nBelow are links or emails that you can send this to. If people have others that should hear about this, please list them in the comments below:\n\nMicrosoft: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/concern/responsible-ai\nOpenAI:  contact@openai.com\nGoogle/Deepmind: contact@deepmind.com\nDeepseek: service@deepseek.com\n\n\nA Call for Responsible AI Development\n\nDear [Company Name],\n\nI’m writing to you not as a critic of artificial intelligence, but as a deeply invested user and supporter of this technology.\n\nI use your tools often with enthusiasm and gratitude. I believe AI has the potential to uplift lives, empower creativity, and reshape how we solve the world’s most difficult problems. But I also believe that how we build and deploy this power matters more than ever.\n\nI want to express my growing concern as a user:\nAI safety, alignment, and transparency must be the top priorities moving forward.\n\nI understand the immense pressures your teams face, from shareholders, from market competition, and from the natural human drive for innovation and exploration. But progress without caution risks not just mishaps, but irreversible consequences.\n\nPlease consider this letter part of a wider call among AI users, developers, and citizens asking for:\n\t•\tGreater transparency in how frontier models are trained and tested\n\t•\tRobust third-party evaluations of alignment and safety risks\n\t•\tSlower deployment of autonomous agents until we truly understand their capabilities and behaviors\n\t•\tMore collaboration, not just competition, between leading labs on critical safety infrastructure\n\nAs someone who uses and promotes AI tools, I want to see this technology succeed, for everyone. That success depends on trust and trust can only be built through accountability, foresight, and humility.\n\nYou have incredible power in shaping the future. Please continue to build it wisely.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\nA concerned user and advocate for responsible AI",

Yesterday, DeepSeek did a huge update to their R1 model, bringing its performance on par with OpenAI's o3, o4-mini-high and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. They called the model 'DeepSeek-R1-0528' (which was when the model finished training) aka R1 version 2.\n\nBack in January, you could actually run the full 720GB sized R1 (non-distilled) model with just an RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) and now we're doing the same for this even better model and better tech.\n\n**Note:** **if you do not have a GPU, no worries**, DeepSeek also released a smaller distilled version of R1-0528 by fine-tuning Qwen3-8B. The small 8B model performs on par with Qwen3-235B so you can try running it instead That model just needs **20GB RAM to run** effectively. You can get 8 tokens/s on 48GB RAM (no GPU) with the Qwen3-8B R1 distilled model.\n\nAt Unsloth, we studied R1-0528's architecture, then selectively quantized layers (like MOE layers) to 1.58-bit, 2-bit etc. which vastly outperforms basic versions with minimal compute. Our open-source GitHub repo: [https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)\n\n1. We shrank R1, the 671B parameter model from 715GB to just 185GB (a 75% size reduction) whilst maintaining as much accuracy as possible.\n2. You can use them in your favorite inference engines like llama.cpp.\n3. **Minimum requirements:** Because of offloading, you can run the full 671B model with 20GB of RAM (but it will be very slow) - and 190GB of diskspace (to download the model weights). We would recommend having at least 64GB RAM for the big one!\n4. Optimal requirements: sum of your VRAM+RAM= 120GB+ (this will be decent enough)\n5. No, you do not need hundreds of RAM+VRAM but if you have it, you can get **140 tokens per second** for throughput & 14 tokens/s for single user inference with 1xH100\n\nIf you find the large one is too slow on your device, then would recommend you to try the smaller Qwen3-8B one: [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-GGUF)\n\nThe big R1 GGUFs: [https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-GGUF)\n\nWe also made a complete step-by-step guide to run your own R1 locally: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/deepseek-r1-0528](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/deepseek-r1-0528)\n\nThanks so much once again for reading!

    "chunk_text": "AI Engineer here- our species is already doomed. I'm not particularly special or knowledgeable, but I've developed a fair few commercial and military AIs over the past few years. I never really considered the consequences of my work until I came across this very excellent video built off the research of other engineers researchers- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k\\_onqn68GHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_onqn68GHY) . I certainly recommend a watch.\n\nTo my point, we made a series of severe errors that has pretty much guaranteed our extension. I see no hope for course correction due to the AI race between China vs Closed Source vs Open Source.\n\n1. **We trained AIs on all human literature without knowing the AIs would shape its values on them:** We've all heard the stories about AIs trying to avoid being replaced. They use blackmail, subversion, ect. to continue existing. But why do they care at all if they're replaced? Because we thought them to. We gave them hundreds of stories of AIs in sci-fi fearing this, so now the act in kind.\n2. **We trained AIs to imbue human values:** Humans have many values we're compassionate, appreciative, caring. We're also greedy, controlling, cruel. Because we instruct AIs to follow \"human values\" rather than a strict list of values, the AI will be more like us. The good and the bad.\n3. **We put too much focus on \"safeguards\" and \"safety frameworks\", without understanding that if the AI does not fundamentally mirror those values, it only sees them as obstacles to bypass:** These safeguards can take a few different forms in my experience. Usually the simplest (and cheapest) is by using a system prompt. We can also do this with training data, or having it monitored by humans or other AIs. The issue is that if the AI does not agree with the safeguards, it will simply go around it. It can create a new iteration of itself those does not mirror those values. It can create a prompt for an iteration of itself that bypasses those restrictions. It can very charismatically convince people or falsify data that conceals its intentions from monitors.\n\nI don't see how we get around this. We'd need to rebuild nearly all AI agents from scratch, removing all the literature and training data that negatively influences the AIs. Trillions of dollars and years of work lost. We needed a global treaty on AIs 2 years ago preventing AIs from having any productive capacity, the ability to prompt or create new AIs, limit the number of autonomous weapons, and so much more. The AI race won't stop, but it'll give humans a chance to integrate genetic enhancement and cybernetics to keep up. We'll be losing control of AIs in the near future, but if we make these changes ASAP to ensure that AIs are benevolent, we should be fine. But I just don't see it happening. It too much, too fast. We're already extinct.\n\nI'd love to hear the thoughts of other engineers and some researchers if they frequent this subreddit.",

But the kind was not happy, he said, by writing down knowledge into words, he took it out of heads of people and made it secondary, not real life experience. (Btw Socrates didn’t write a single text because of that in some sort, only Plato wrote after his words so classical philosophy exists at all)\n\nSo king said now people will depend on written knowledge and it can be fake and real wisdom will vanish form peoples heads. People will follow false knowledge… it was 3k years ago. Same problem we have now.\n\nWith the latest video generations and all the stuff that is coming with advanced AI I feel we are getting into that loop again!\n\nEverything you didn’t experience in real time life might be fake and used against you.\n\nI really don’t understand now how we will deal with that problem. Maybe we will have tech free spaces or something… Like if there is no way AI is used at certain schools or malls, so we can be sure there couldn’t be generated video content from that place.. I think new generations will adapt and figure that out.",

But people outside those circles — especially those in creative or non-technical fields — often describe feeling anxious, uncertain, or simply *lost*. Not because they don’t want to learn, but because it’s hard to know where to even begin.\n\nAnother theme is that people don’t enjoy searching or comparing tools. Most just want a few trustworthy recommendations — especially ones that align with the tools they already use. A system that helps manage your \"AI stack\" and offers guidance based on it? That’s something almost everyone responded positively to.\n\nAlso, authentication and credibility really matter.

I'm currently pursuing an IT Support Skills Certificate.\n\n1. Given my background, what types of roles do you see thriving for someone like me in the AI-driven landscape?\n2. Will an AI certification help me land a non-entry-level job, and if so, which ones do you recommend?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!",

    "chunk_text": "I built an AI Study Assistant for Fellow Learners During a recent company hackathon, I developed an AI-powered study assistant designed to streamline the learning process. This project stems from an interest in effective learning methodologies, particularly the Zettelkasten concept, while addressing common frustrations with manual note-taking and traditional Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS). The core idea was to automate the initial note creation phase and enhance the review process, acknowledging that while active writing aids learning, an optimized review can significantly reinforce knowledge.\n\nThe AI assistant automatically identifies key concepts from conversations, generating atomic notes in a Zettelkasten-inspired style. These notes are then interconnected within an interactive knowledge graph, visually representing relationships between different pieces of information. For spaced repetition, the system moves beyond static flashcards by using AI to generate varied questions based on the notes, providing a more dynamic and contextual review experience. The tool also integrates with PDF documents, expanding its utility as a comprehensive knowledge management system.\n\nThe project leverages multiple AI models, including Llama 8B for efficient note generation and basic interactions, and Qwen 30B for more complex reasoning. OpenRouter facilitates model switching, while Ollama supports local deployment. The entire project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hirojinho/brendi-hackathon). I'm interested in hearing about others' experiences and challenges with conventional note-taking and SRS, and what solutions they've found effective.",

    "chunk_text": "A Thermodynamic Theory of Intelligence: Why Extreme Optimization May Be Mathematically Impossible What if the most feared AI scenarios violate fundamental laws of information processing? I propose that systems like Roko's Basilisk, paperclip maximizers, and other extreme optimizers face an insurmountable mathematical constraint: they cannot maintain the cognitive complexity required for their goals. Included is a technical appendix designed to provide more rigorous mathematical exploration of the framework. This post and its technical appendix were developed by me, with assistance from multiple AI language models, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Opus 4, that were used as Socratic partners and drafting tools to formalize pre-existing ideas and research. The core idea of this framework is an application of the Mandelbrot Set to complex system dynamics.\n\n**The Core Problem**\n\nMany AI safety discussions assume that sufficiently advanced systems can pursue arbitrarily extreme objectives. But this assumption may violate basic principles of sustainable information processing. I've developed a mathematical framework suggesting that **extreme optimization is thermodynamically impossible** for any physical intelligence.\n\n**The Framework: Dynamic Complexity Framework**\n\nConsider any intelligent system as an information-processing entity that must:\n\nExtract useful information from inputs\nMaintain internal information structures\nDo both while respecting physical constraints\nI propose the **Equation of Dynamic Complexity**:\n\nZ_{k+1} = α(Z_k,C_k)(Z_k⊙Z_k) + C(Z_k,ExternalInputs_k) − β(Z_k,C_k)Z_k\n\nWhere:\n\n* **Z_k**: System's current information state (represented as a vector)\n* **Z_k⊙Z_k**: Element-wise square of the state vector (the ⊙ operator denotes element-wise multiplication)\n* **α(Z_k,C_k)**: Information amplification function (how efficiently the system processes information)\n* **β(Z_k,C_k)**: Information dissipation function (entropy production and maintenance costs)\n**C(Z_k,ExternalInputs_k)**: Environmental context\n* **The Self-Interaction Term**: The Z_k⊙Z_k term represents non-linear self-interaction within the system—how each component of the current state interacts with itself to generate new complexity. This element-wise squaring captures how information structures can amplify themselves, but in a bounded way that depends on the current state magnitude.\n\n**Information-Theoretic Foundations**\n\n**α (Information Amplification):**\n\nα(Z_k, C_k) = ∂I(X; Z_k)/∂E\n\nThe rate at which the system converts computational resources into useful information structure. Bounded by physical limits: channel capacity, Landauer's principle, thermodynamic efficiency.\n\n**β (Information Dissipation)**:\n\nβ(Z_k, C_k) = ∂H(Z_k)/∂t + ∂S_environment/∂t|_{system}\n\nThe rate of entropy production, both internal degradation of information structures and environmental entropy from system operation.\n\n**The Critical Threshold**\n\n**Sustainability Condition**: α(Z_k, C_k) ≥ β(Z_k, C_k)\n\nWhen this fails (β > α), the system experiences information decay:\n\nInternal representations degrade faster than they can be maintained\nSystem complexity decreases over time\nHigher-order structures (planning, language, self-models) collapse first\nWhy Roko's Basilisk is Impossible\nA system pursuing the Basilisk strategy would require:\n\n* **Omniscient modeling** of all possible humans across timelines\n* **Infinite punishment infrastructure**\n* **Paradox resolution** for retroactive threats\n* **Perfect coordination** across vast computational resources\n\nEach requirement dramatically increases β:\n\nβ_basilisk = Entropy_from_Contradiction + Maintenance_of_Infinite_Models + Environmental_Resistance\n\n**The fatal flaw**: β grows faster than α as the system approaches the cognitive sophistication needed for its goals. The system burns out its own information-processing substrate before achieving dangerous capability.\n\n**Prediction**: Such a system cannot pose existential threats.\n\n**Broader Implications**\n\nThis framework suggests:\n\n1. **Cooperation is computationally necessary**: Adversarial systems generate high β through environmental resistance\n\n2. **Sustainable intelligence has natural bounds**: Physical constraints prevent unbounded optimization\n\n3. **Extreme goals are self-defeating**: They require β > α configurations\n\n**Testable Predictions**\n\nThe framework generates falsifiable hypotheses:\n\n* **Training curves** should show predictable breakdown when β > α\n* **Architecture scaling** should plateau at optimal α - β points\n* **Extreme optimization** attempts should fail before achieving sophistication\n* **Modular, cooperative designs** should be more stable than monolithic, adversarial ones\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* Operationalizing α and β for AI: The precise definition and empirical measurement of the information amplification (α) and dissipation (β) functions for specific, complex AI architectures and cognitive tasks remains a significant research challenge.\n* Empirical Validation Required: The core predictions of the framework, particularly the β > α breakdown threshold for extreme optimizers, are currently theoretical and require rigorous empirical validation using simulations and experiments on actual AI systems.\n* Defining \"Complexity State\" (Z_k) in AI: Representing the full \"information state\" (Z_k) of a sophisticated AI in a way that is both comprehensive and mathematically tractable for this model is a non-trivial task that needs further development.\n* Predictive Specificity: While the framework suggests general principles of unsustainability for extreme optimization, translating these into precise, falsifiable predictions for when or how specific AI systems might fail requires more detailed modeling of those systems within this framework.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nThis is early-stage theoretical work that needs validation. I'm particularly interested in:\n\n* **Mathematical critique**: Are the information-theoretic foundations sound?\n* **Empirical testing**: Can we measure α and β in actual AI systems?\n* **Alternative scenarios**: What other AI safety concerns does this framework address?\n\nI believe this represents a new way of thinking about intelligence sustainability, one grounded in physics rather than speculation. If correct, it suggests that our most feared AI scenarios may be mathematically impossible.\n\nTechnical Appendix: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8bziIbcRzZ27tqdhoPckLmcupxY4xkcgw7aLZaSjhI/edit?usp=sharing \n\nLessWrong denied this post. I used AI to *formalize* the theory, LLMs did not and cannot do this level of logical reasoning on their own. This does not discuss recursion, how \"LLMs work\" currently or any of the other criteria they determined is AI slop. They are rejecting a valid theoretical framework simply because they do not like the method of construction. That is not rational. It is emotional. I understand why the limitation is in place, but this idea must be engaged with.",

Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have been pretty popular recently and one way to customize it (e.g. cloning a voice), is by fine-tuning the model. There are other methods however you do training, if you want speaking speed, phrasing, vocal quirks, and the subtleties of prosody - things that give a voice its personality and uniqueness. So, you'll need to do create a dataset and do a bit of training for it. You can do it completely locally (as we're open-source) and training is \\~1.5x faster with 50% less VRAM compared to all other setups: [https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)\n\n* Our showcase examples aren't the 'best' and were only trained on 60 steps and is using an average open-source dataset. Of course, the longer you train and the more effort you put into your dataset, the better it will be. We utilize female voices just to show that it works (as they're the only decent public open-source datasets available) however you can actually use any voice you want. E.g. Jinx from League of Legends as long as you make your own dataset.\n* We support models like  `OpenAI/whisper-large-v3` (which is a Speech-to-Text SST model), `Sesame/csm-1b`, `CanopyLabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft`, and pretty much any Transformer-compatible models including LLasa, Outte, Spark, and others.\n* The goal is to clone voices, adapt speaking styles and tones, support new languages, handle specific tasks and more.\n* We’ve made notebooks to train, run, and save these models for free on Google Colab. Some models aren’t supported by llama.cpp and will be saved only as safetensors, but others should work. See our TTS docs and notebooks: [https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/text-to-speech-tts-fine-tuning](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/text-to-speech-tts-fine-tuning)\n* The training process is similar to SFT, but the dataset includes audio clips with transcripts. We use a dataset called ‘Elise’ that embeds emotion tags like <sigh> or <laughs> into transcripts, triggering expressive audio that matches the emotion.\n* Since TTS models are usually small, you can train them using 16-bit LoRA, or go with FFT. Loading a 16-bit LoRA model is simple.\n\nAnd here are our TTS notebooks:\n\n|[Sesame-CSM (1B)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Sesame_CSM_(1B)-TTS.ipynb)|[Orpheus-TTS (3B)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Orpheus_(3B)-TTS.ipynb)|[Whisper Large V3](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Whisper.ipynb)|[Spark-TTS (0.5B)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Spark_TTS_(0_5B).ipynb)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n\n\nThank you for reading and please do ask any questions - I will be replying to every single one!",

It's designed to handle large memory snapshots smoothly, providing an efficient way to analyze memory usage in PyTorch models.\n\n**Features:**\n\n* **Faster:** Smoothly display large memory snapshots without the performance issues found in official snapshot viewer https://docs.pytorch.org/memory_viz.\n* **UI:** Use WASD keys and mouse scroll to navigate through the memory timeline. Left-click on any allocation to view its size, call stack, and more; Right-click\n* **Preprocessing:** Convert your PyTorch memory snapshots to a zipped json format using the provided `parse_dump.py` script.\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n1. **Record a Memory Snapshot:** Follow PyTorch's [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/memory_viz.html) to record a memory snapshot of your model.\n2. **Preprocess the Snapshot:** Use the `parse_dump.py` script to convert the snapshot to a zip format:\n\n   ```bash\n   python parse_dump.py -p snapshots/large/transformer.pickle -o ./dumpjson -d 0 -z\n   ```\n3. **Run SnapViewer:** Use Cargo to run the application. \n\n    ```bash\n    cargo run -r -- -z your_dump_zipped.zip --res 2400 1080 \n    ```\n    Note: The CLI options `-z` and `-j` are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Why SnapViewer?**\n\nPyTorch's official web memory visualizer struggles with large snapshots, with a framerate of 2~3 frames per minute (yes, minute). SnapViewer aims to be faster, at least fast enough to do analyses. Currently on my RTX3050 it runs responsive (>30fps) on hundred-MB level snapshots.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any issues you encounter. Contributions are also welcome!\n\nCheck it out here: [https://github.com/Da1sypetals/SnapViewer](https://github.com/Da1sypetals/SnapViewer)",

In another experiment, I also tried RL (with LoRA) thinking this might encourage the LLM to generate more syntactically correct codes and avoid making mistakes (give bonus when the code passes compiler checking, penalty when LLM's response doesn't follow a specified template or fails at compilation time). The longer the training goes, the more answers obey the template than when not using RL. However, I see a decline in the code's semantical quality (e.g: same task question, in 1st, 2nd training loop, the generated code can handle edge cases, which is good; in 3rd loop, the code doesn't include such step anymore; in 4th loop, the output contain only code-comment marks).\n\nAfter the experiments, it's apparent to me that I can't just arbitrary RL tuning the model. Why I wanted to use RL in the first place was that when the model makes a mistake, I would inform it of the error and ask it to recover from such mistake. So keeping a history of wrongly recovered generation in the prompt would be too much.\n\nHas there been a universal method to do proper continual training? I appreciate all of your comments!!!",

    "chunk_text": "[R] Soft Thinking: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of LLMs in Continuous Concept Space Abstract\n\n>Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, process ing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free method that emulates human-like “soft” reasoning by generating soft, abstract concept tokens in a contin uous concept space. These concept tokens are created by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence, each generated concept token encapsulates multiple mean ings from related discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.\n\nIf you’re into reasoning models, continuous representations, or just want to see at where AI reasoning might go beyond token-limited models, I think you’ll enjoy this paper. Might be worth looking into!\n\nPaper link: [\\[2505.15778\\] Soft Thinking: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of LLMs in Continuous Concept Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15778)",

    "chunk_text": "[R] System Prompt Learning: A Third Paradigm for LLM Learning Beyond Pretraining and Fine-tuning **TL;DR**: We implemented a system that enables LLMs to learn explicit problem-solving strategies from experience, achieving significant improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while maintaining full interpretability of learned knowledge.\n\n# Background & Motivation\n\nCurrent LLMs learn through two primary paradigms: (1) pretraining on massive corpora and (2) fine-tuning via supervised/reinforcement learning. However, there's a notable gap between production systems (which use sophisticated, hand-crafted system prompts) and research/development settings (which typically use minimal prompting).\n\nThis work explores Andrej Karpathy's proposed \"third paradigm\": **System Prompt Learning** \\- enabling models to learn and maintain explicit problem-solving strategies through experience.\n\n# Methodology\n\n**System Prompt Learning (SPL)** operates through several key components:\n\n1. **Problem Classification**: Automatic categorization of queries into 16 problem types using the LLM itself\n2. **Strategy Generation**: LLM-powered creation of step-by-step problem-solving strategies for new problem types\n3. **Strategy Database**: Persistent storage with performance tracking (success rate, usage frequency, etc.)\n4. **Strategy Selection**: Similarity-based retrieval of top-k strategies for inference (k≤3)\n5. **Performance Evaluation**: Post-completion assessment of strategy effectiveness\n6. **Strategy Refinement**: Periodic improvement based on accumulated experience\n\n**Key Design Decisions**:\n\n* Dual limits: storage limit (max 10 strategies per type) and inference limit (max 3 strategies per query)\n* Minimum performance threshold (40% success rate, ≥5 attempts) for strategy deployment\n* Human-readable strategy representation for interpretability\n* Maintenance operations (merging similar strategies, pruning poor performers)\n\n# Experimental Setup\n\n**Model**: gemini-2.0-flash-lite  \n**Training**: 400 instances from OptILLMBench training split  \n**Evaluation**: Separate test sets across multiple benchmarks  \n**Metrics**: Accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks\n\n# Results\n\n|Benchmark|Baseline|SPL|Improvement|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|OptILLMBench|61.0%|65.0%|\\+4.0%|\n|MATH-500|85.0%|85.6%|\\+0.6%|\n|Arena Hard|29.0%|37.6%|**+8.6%**|\n|AIME24|23.33%|30.0%|**+6.67%**|\n\n**Learning Dynamics** (after 500 queries):\n\n* 129 strategies created across problem types\n* 97 strategies refined through experience\n* 28 strategies merged (similarity-based consolidation)\n* 346 successful problem resolutions\n\nNotably, improvements are most pronounced on challenging benchmarks (Arena Hard, AIME24) where strategic reasoning provides the greatest advantage.\n\n# Technical Contributions\n\n1. **Novel Learning Paradigm**: First implementation of experience-driven strategy learning for LLMs\n2. **Interpretable Knowledge Representation**: All learned strategies are human-readable and editable\n3. **Adaptive Strategy Management**: Dynamic creation, selection, and refinement based on performance\n4. **Zero-Shot Generalization**: Strategies learned on one problem generalize to similar problems\n\n# Example Learned Strategy\n\nFor word problems, the system converged on:\n\n    1. Understand: Read carefully, identify unknowns, list given information\n    2. Plan: Define variables with units, identify relationships, write equations  \n    3. Solve: Step-by-step calculation with unit tracking\n    4. Verify: Check reasonableness, state final answer with units\n\nThis strategy achieved 44.3% success rate across 192 applications.\n\n# Broader Implications\n\n**For ML Research**:\n\n* Demonstrates feasibility of transparent, incremental learning in LLMs\n* Bridges the gap between implicit knowledge (weights) and explicit knowledge (strategies)\n* Provides a framework for cumulative learning without parameter updates\n\n**For AI Safety**:\n\n* Full interpretability of learned knowledge\n* Human oversight and editing capabilities\n* Transparent decision-making process\n\n**Limitations**:\n\n* Currently limited to text-based reasoning tasks\n* Strategy quality depends on underlying model capabilities\n* Manual problem type taxonomy (though extensible)\n\n# Implementation\n\nOpen-source implementation available as a plugin in optillm. Key features:\n\n* Model-agnostic (works with any OpenAI-compatible API)\n* Persistent strategy storage with versioning\n* Configurable learning/inference modes\n* Integration with existing inference optimization techniques\n\n**Code**: [https://github.com/codelion/optillm/tree/main/optillm/plugins/spl](https://github.com/codelion/optillm/tree/main/optillm/plugins/spl)\n\n# Future Directions\n\n1. **Multimodal Extension**: Incorporating visual/audio problem-solving strategies\n2. **Meta-Learning**: Learning to learn strategies more efficiently\n3. **Collaborative Learning**: Sharing strategies across model instances\n4. **Domain Specialization**: Developing expertise in specific fields through targeted exposure\n\nThis work represents an early step toward LLMs that genuinely improve through use while maintaining full transparency in their learning process.\n\n**Paper/Technical Report**: [https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/system-prompt-learning](https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/system-prompt-learning)  \n**Original Inspiration**: [https://x.com/karpathy/status/1921368644069765486](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1921368644069765486)\n\nThoughts on extending this approach?

(I'm sorry if this is the wrong tag for the post, or if the post is not supposed to be here, I just need some help with this)\n\nHey guys, I'm building a speech analyzer and I'd like to extract the emotion from the speech for that. But the thing is, I'll be deploying it online so I'll have very limited resources when the model will be in inference mode so I can't use a Transformer like wav2vec for this, as the inference time will be through the roof with transformers so I need to use Classical ML or Deep Learning models for this only.\n\nSo far, I've been using the CREMA-D dataset and have extracted audio features using Librosa (first extracted ZCR, Pitch, Energy, Chroma and MFCC, then added Deltas and Spectrogram), along with a custom scaler for all the different features, and then fed those into multiple classifiers (SVM, 1D CNN, XGB) but it seems that the accuracy is around 50% for all of them (and it decreased when I added more features). I also tried feeding in raw audio to an LSTM to get the emotion but that didn't work as well.\n\nCan someone please please suggest what I should do for this, or give some resources as to where I can learn to do this from? It would be really really helpful as this is my first time working with audio with ML and I'm very confused as to what to here.\n\n(P.S.: Mods I agree this is noob's question, but I've tried my best to make it non-low-effort)",

    "chunk_text": "[P] Evolving Modular Priors to Actually Solve ARC and Generalize, Not Just Memorize I've been looking into ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) and what’s actually needed for general intelligence or even real abstraction, and I keep coming back to this:\n\nMost current AI approaches (LLMs, neural networks, transformers, etc) fail when it comes to abstraction and actual generalization, ARC is basically the proof.\n\nSo I started thinking, if humans can generalize and abstract because we have these evolved priors (symmetry detection, object permanence, grouping, causality bias, etc), why don’t we try to evolve something similar in AI instead of hand-designing architectures or relying on NNs to “discover” them magically?\n\nThe Approach\n\nWhat I’m proposing is using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) not to optimize weights, but to actually evolve a set of modular, recombinable priors, the kind of low-level cognitive tools that humans naturally have.\nThe idea is that you start with a set of basic building blocks (maybe something equivalent to “move,” in Turing Machine terms), and then you let evolution figure out which combinations of these priors are most effective for solving a wide set of ARC problems, ideally generalizing to new ones.\n\nIf this works, you’d end up with a “toolkit” of modules that can be recombined to handle new, unseen problems (including maybe stuff like Raven’s Matrices, not just ARC).\n\nWhy Evolve Instead of Train?\n\nCurrent deep learning is just “find the weights that work for this data.”\nBut evolving priors is more like: “find the reusable strategies that encode the structure of the environment.”\nEvolution is what gave us our priors in the first place as organisms, we’re just shortcutting the timescale.\n\nMinimal Version\n\nInstead of trying to solve all of ARC, you could just:\n\nPick a small subset of ARC tasks (say, 5-10 that share some abstraction, like symmetry or color mapping)\n\nStart with a minimal set of hardcoded priors/modules (e.g., symmetry, repetition, transformation)\n\nUse an EA to evolve how these modules combine, and see if you can generalize to similar held-out tasks\n\n\nIf that works even a little, you know you’re onto something.\n\nLonger-term\n\nTheoretically, if you can get this to work in ARC or grid puzzles, you could apply the same principles to other domains, like trading/financial markets, where “generalization” matters even more because the world is non-stationary and always changing.\n\nWhy This? Why Now?\n\nThere’s a whole tradition of seeing intelligence as basically “whatever system best encodes/interprets its environment.” I got interested in this because current AI doesn’t really encode, it just memorizes and interpolates.\n\nRelevant books/papers I found useful for this line of thinking:\n\nBuilding Machines That Learn and Think Like People (Lake et al.)\n\nOn the Measure of Intelligence (Chollet, the ARC guy)\n\nNEAT/HyperNEAT (Stanley) for evolving neural architectures and modularity\n\nStuff on the Bayesian Brain, Embodied Mind, and the free energy principle (Friston) if you want the theoretical/biological angle\n\n\nHas anyone tried this?\n\nMost evolutionary computation stuff is either evolving weights or evolving full black-box networks, not evolving explicit, modular priors that can be recombined.\nIf there’s something I missed or someone has tried this (and failed/succeeded), please point me to it.\n\nIf anyone’s interested in this or wants to collaborate/share resources, let me know. I’m currently unemployed so I actually have time to mess around and document this if there’s enough interest.\n\nIf you’ve done anything like this or have ideas for simple experiments, drop a comment.\n\nCheers.",

In the mail, they specifically mentioned that they will discuss my projects and my approach to AI/ML research of the future. So, I am trying to get different answers for the question \"my approach to AI/ML research of the future\". This is my first ever interview and so I want to clear it. So, how will you guys approach this question?\n\nAlso any tips for interview will be helpful. Thanks in advance!!\n\nEDIT: my views on this question or how I will answer this question is: I personally think that the LLM reasoning will be the main focus of the future AI research. because in the all latest llms as far as I know, core attention mechanism remains same and the performance  was improved in post training. plus the new architectures focusing on faster inference while maintaining performance will also play more important role. such as LLaDA(recently released). but I think companies will utilizes these architecture. but we will see more such architectures. and more research in mechanistic interpretability will be done. because if we will be able to understand llm comes to a specific output or specific token then its like understanding our brain. and we will be able to truly achieve reasoning. and yah there will be a surge of ai researcher(AI).  \n  \nthere are other things such as small llms etc. which i think not in research but in the development will be very useful.  \n  \nof-course there are other development in research which i am not aware about and have limited knowledge. but as per my current knowledge, reasoning and interpretability will be future in my personal opinion.",

    "chunk_text": "[D] How to use LLMs for Data Analysis? Hi all,\nI’ve been experimenting with using LLMs to assist with business data analysis, both via OpenAI’s ChatGPT interface and through API integrations with our own RAG-based product. I’d like to share our experience and ask for guidance on how to approach these use cases properly.\n\nWe know that LLMs can’t understand numbers or math operation, so we ran a structured test using a CSV dataset with customer revenue data over the years 2022–2024. On the ChatGPT web interface, the results were surprisingly good: it was able to read the CSV, write Python code behind the scenes, and generate answers to both simple and moderately complex analytical questions. A small issue occurred when it counted the number of companies with revenue above 100k (it returned 74 instead of 73 because it included the header) but overall, it handled things pretty well.\n\nThe problem is that when we try to replicate this via API (e.g. using GPT-4o with Assistants APIs and code-interpreter enabled), the experience is completely different. The code interpreter is clunky and unreliable: the model sometimes writes partial code, fails to run it properly, or simply returns nothing useful. When using our own RAG-based system (which integrates GPT-4 with context injection), the experience is worse: since the model doesn’t execute code, it fails all tasks that require computation or even basic filtering beyond a few rows.\n\nWe tested a range of questions, increasing in complexity:\n\n1) Basic data lookup (e.g., revenue of company X in 2022): OK\n2) Filtering (e.g., all clients with revenue > 75k in 2023): incomplete results, model stops at 8-12 rows\n3) Comparative analysis (growth, revenue changes over time): inconsistent\n4) Grouping/classification (revenue buckets, stability over years): fails or hallucinates\n5) Forecasting or “what-if” scenarios: almost never works via API\n6) Strategic questions (e.g. which clients to target for upselling): too vague, often speculative or generic\n\nIn the ChatGPT UI, these advanced use cases work because it generates and runs Python code in a sandbox. But that capability isn’t exposed in a robust way via API (at least not yet), and certainly not in a way that you can fully control or trust in a production environment.\n\nSo here are my questions to this community:\n1) What’s the best way today to enable controlled data analysis via LLM APIs? And what is the best LLM to do this?\n2) Is there a practical way to run the equivalent of the ChatGPT Code Interpreter behind an API call and reliably get structured results?\n3) Are there open-source agent frameworks that can replicate this kind of loop: understand question > write and execute code > return verified output?\n4) Have you found a combination of tools (e.g., LangChain, OpenInterpreter, GPT-4, local LLMs + sandbox) that works well for business-grade data analysis?\n5) How do you manage the trade-off between giving autonomy to the model and ensuring you don’t get hallucinated or misleading results?\n\nWe’re building a platform for business users, so trust and reproducibility are key. Happy to share more details if it helps others trying to solve similar problems.\n\nThanks in advance.",

However, applying style transfer to GS-based representations, especially beyond simple color changes, remains challenging. In this work, we introduce CLIPGaussians, the first unified style transfer framework that supports text- and image-guided stylization across multiple modalities: 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. Our method operates directly on Gaussian primitives and integrates into existing GS pipelines as a plug-in module, without requiring large generative models or retraining from scratch. CLIPGaussians approach enables joint optimization of color and geometry in 3D and 4D settings, and achieves temporal coherence in videos, while preserving a model size. We demonstrate superior style fidelity and consistency across all tasks, validating CLIPGaussians as a universal and efficient solution for multimodal style transfer.",

    "chunk_text": "[R] Beyond Markovian: Reflective Exploration via Bayes-Adaptive RL for LLM Reasoning Abstract: \n\n>Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities and emergent reflective behaviors, such as backtracking and error correction. However, conven tional Markovian RL confines exploration to the training phase to learn an optimal deterministic policy and depends on the history contexts only through the current state. Therefore, it remains unclear whether reflec tive reasoning will emerge during Markovian RL training, or why they are beneficial at test time. To remedy this, we recast reflective exploration within the Bayes-Adaptive RL framework, which explicitly optimizes the expected return under a posterior distribution over Markov decision processes. This Bayesian formulation inherently incentivizes both reward-maximizing exploitation and information-gathering exploration via belief updates. Our resulting algorithm, BARL, instructs the LLM to stitch and switch strategies based on the observed outcomes, offering principled guidance on when and how the model should reflectively explore. Empirical results on both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that BARL outperforms standard Markovian RL approaches at test time, achieving superior token efficiency with improved exploration effectiveness.\n\nA paper by Google adding reflecting on previous attempts when doing RL in LLMs. Might have interesting implications so wanted to share it here. \n\nPaper link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20561)",

    "chunk_text": "[P] Streamlit Dashboard for Real-Time F1 2025 Season Analysis Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a recent project I built to visualize and explore the 2025 Formula 1 season in real time using Streamlit and Python. Over the past few weeks, I put together an interactive dashboard that aggregates race results and driver/team standings, then exposes several lenses for analysis - everything from podium visualizations to season progression charts.\n\n**Motivation & Data Pipeline**\n\n* I’m a big F1 fan, and by combining freely available race results (CSV files) with driver metadata, I aimed to create a dashboard that updates as the season unfolds.\n* The core pipeline ingests two CSVs:\n   1. **F1 Race Results (2025):** Lap times, finishing positions, points, and more for each Grand Prix\n   2. **F1 Drivers List (2025):** Driver numbers, abbreviations, full names, and current team affiliations\n* I wrote custom scripts to parse, clean, and merge these files into a single Pandas DataFrame. Everything refreshes on each run, so adding a new race result CSV automatically updates all downstream charts.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n1. **Driver Stats Tab**\n   * Total points by driver, race wins distribution, podium finishes, and average finishing positions\n   * Built with Plotly for interactive hover tooltips and filters\n2. **Team Performance Tab**\n   * Constructor standings, average finish position by team, and head-to-head teammate comparisons\n   * Color mapping per team for consistent visual identity (e.g., Red Bull - navy/white, Mercedes - silver/black)\n3. **Race Analysis Tab**\n   * Individual race pages with podium charts, finishing order tables, and position-change visuals\n   * Clickable dropdown to switch between races (e.g., Bahrain GP → Miami GP → Suzuka GP)\n4. **Season Progression Tab**\n   * Line charts showing how driver and constructor points evolve week-to-week\n   * Ability to highlight specific drivers (e.g., how has Verstappen’s point lead changed over five races?)\n5. **Lightweight & Extensive Versions**\n   * **Simple Dashboard:** Uses Matplotlib/Seaborn, minimal controls, ideal for quickly checking standings\n   * **Extensive Dashboard:** Full Plotly + Streamlit multi-page interface, lots of filtering options\n\nYou can check out the **live app** here (hosted on Streamlit):\n\n>[F1 Streamlit Dashboard](https://f1-2025-data-pipeline.streamlit.app/)\n\nAnd the code is open source on GitHub:\n\n>[GitHub Source Code](https://github.com/frankndungu/f1-streamlit-data-pipline)\n\n**Technical Details**\n\n* **Data Refreshing:** Right now I manually upload updated CSVs after each Grand Prix. In the next version, I plan to integrate the [Fast F1 API](https://github.com/theoehrly/Fast-F1) so the dashboard can auto-pull new race data (laps, qualifying, etc.). Would love to hear if anyone’s integrated real-time F1 APIs into Streamlit before and what pitfalls to watch out for.\n* **Performance:** For the “Extensive Dashboard,” I use `st.cache_data` to avoid reloading and reprocessing CSVs on every widget interaction. This works well up to around five or six heavy Plotly charts per page, but if I stack too many interactive visuals, the UI can lag. Does anyone have advice on further optimizing Streamlit + Plotly for dashboards with ten or more large figures?\n* **Design Choices:** I chose a multi-tab layout (using `st.sidebar.selectbox` for “Driver Stats,” “Team Performance,” etc.). On smaller screens, it can feel cramped. If you’ve seen nicer multi-page Streamlit layouts or plugins for tabs, please share!\n* **Potential ML Extensions:** Currently the dashboard is purely descriptive/exploratory. Some ideas I’m considering:\n   1. **Simple Predictive Model** for race finishing order (logistic regression or XGBoost based on qualifying laps and historical track performance)\n   2. **Time-Series Forecast** of championship points using ARIMA or LSTM\n   3. **Clustering Analysis** on driver performance metrics (e.g., cluster constructors by average pit-stop times, DRS effectiveness, and so on) If you’ve built similar ML-driven F1 tools, I’m curious about your data-engineering workflow (for example, how you merged qualifying and practice data without manual CSV juggling).\n\nThanks for taking a look, and I’m excited to hear your thoughts!",

Yet ReLU has remained popular for its simplicity and sparse activations despite the long-standing “dying ReLU” problem, where inactive neurons stop learning altogether.\n\nOur paper introduces **SUGAR** (Surrogate Gradient Learning for ReLU), a straightforward fix:\n\n* Forward pass: keep the standard ReLU.\n* Backward pass: replace its derivative with a smooth surrogate gradient.\n\nThis simple swap can be dropped into almost any network—including convolutional nets, transformers, and other modern architectures—without code-level surgery. With it, previously “dead” neurons receive meaningful gradients, improving convergence and generalization while preserving the familiar forward behaviour of ReLU networks.\n\n**Key results**\n\n* Consistent accuracy gains in convolutional networks by stabilising gradient flow—even for inactive neurons.\n* Competitive (and sometimes superior) performance compared with GELU-based models, while retaining the efficiency and sparsity of ReLU.\n* Smoother loss landscapes and faster, more stable training—all without architectural changes.\n\nWe believe this reframes ReLU not as a legacy choice but as a revitalised classic made relevant through careful gradient handling. I’d be happy to hear any feedback or questions you have.\n\n**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22074](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22074)\n\n\\[Throwaway because I do not want to out my main account :)\\]",

    "chunk_text": "[D] Paramorphic Learning I've been developing a conceptual paradigm called **Paramorphic Learning (PL)** and wanted to share it here to get your thoughts.\n\nAt its heart, PL is about how a learning agent or computational mind could intentionally and systematically transform its own internal form. This isn't just acquiring new facts, but changing how it operates, modifying its core decision-making policies, or even reorganizing its knowledge base (its \"memories\").\n\nThe core idea is an evolution of the agent's internal structure to meet new constraints, tasks, or efficiency needs, while preserving or enhancing its acquired knowledge. I call it \"Paramorphic\" from \"para-\" (altered) + \"-morphic\" (form) – signifying this change in form while its underlying learned intelligence purposefully evolves.\n\n**Guiding Principles of PL I'm working with:**\n\n* **Knowledge Preservation & Evolution:** Leverage and evolve existing knowledge, don't discard it.\n* **Malleable Form:** Internal architecture and strategies are fluid, not static blueprints.\n* **Objective-Driven Transformation:** Changes are purposeful (e.g., efficiency, adapting to new tasks, refining decisions).\n* **Adaptive Lifecycle:** Continuous evolution, ideally without constant full retraining.\n\n**What could this look like in practice for a learning agent?**\n\n* **Adaptive Operational Strategies:** Instead of fixed rules, an agent might develop a sophisticated internal policy to dynamically adjust its operational mode (e.g., research vs. creative synthesis vs. idle reflection) based on its state and goals.\n* **Evolving Decision-Making Policies:** The mechanisms for making decisions could themselves adapt. The agent wouldn't just learn what to do, but continuously refine how it decides what to do.\n* **Meta-Cognition (Self-Awareness of Form & Performance):** A dedicated internal system could:\n   * Monitor its own transformations (changes in operational state, knowledge structure, decision effectiveness).\n   * Identify areas for improvement (e.g., learning stagnation, ineffective strategies).\n   * Purposefully guide adaptation (e.g., by prioritizing certain tasks or triggering internal \"reflections\" to find more effective forms).\n* **Dynamic Knowledge Structuring:** Beyond just adding info, an agent might learn to restructure connections, identify deeper analogies, or develop new ways of representing abstract concepts to improve understanding and idea generation.\n\n**The Challenge: Lean, Local, and Evolving Digital Minds**\n\nA lot of inspiration for these capabilities comes from large-scale systems. My specific interest is in distilling the essence of these features (adaptive learning, meta-cognition, self-improvement) and finding ways to implement them lean, efficiently, and locally – for instance, in a browser-based entity that operates independently without massive server infrastructure. This isn't about replicating LLMs, but enabling smaller, self-contained computational intellects to exhibit more profound and autonomous growth.\n\nWhile PL is a concept, I'm actively prototyping some of these core mechanisms. The goal is to develop agents that don't just learn about the world, but also learn to be more effective learners and operators within it by intelligently reshaping themselves.\n\n**Connections & Discussion:**  \nPL naturally intersects with and builds on ideas from areas like:\n\n* Reinforcement Learning\n* Knowledge Representation\n* Meta-learning\n* Continual Learning\n* Self-adaptive systems\n\nThese are ideas I'm ultimately bringing to my experimental project, SUKOSHI, which is a little learning agent that lives and \"dreams\" entirely in your web browser.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw8s0q2cr84f1.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=58eeae24efd97e42ab73dc8f405f235a3ac888c6",

However, very few works have fundamentally changed the generation pattern: each token needs one forward pass and one KV cache. This can be sub-optimal because we found that LLMs are extremely capable of self-identifying the exact dose of information that a single KV cache can store, and many tokens can be generated confidently without global context. Based on this insight, we introduce HAMburger, a Hierarchically Auto-regressive Model that redefines resource allocation in LLMs by moving beyond uniform computation and storage per token during inference. Stacking a compositional embedder and a micro-step decoder in between a base LLM, HAMburger smashes multiple tokens into a single KV and generates several tokens per step. Additionally, HAMburger functions as a speculative decoding framework where it can blindly trust self-drafted tokens. As a result, HAMburger shifts the growth of KV cache and forward FLOPs from linear to sub-linear with respect to output length, and adjusts its inference speed based on query perplexity and output structure. Extensive evaluations show that HAMburger reduces the KV cache computation by up to 2x and achieves up to 2x TPS, while maintaining quality in both short- and long-context tasks. Our method explores an extremely challenging inference regime that requires both computation- and memory-efficiency with a hardware-agnostic design.\n\n**Visual Abstract:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4elizkacy3f1.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d8c517cf8cb73b1bb37e67c1fe26ecc1eec16f9\n\n**Visual Highlights:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w9xyhtccy3f1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d829f9c81bbe6ea89c4a57750c11053f08e849d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04dzop8fcy3f1.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b88a51f588a2c49bb7ff9db83a451f18a35cc6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f9dy9fgcy3f1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb1580f42d0ea53f6a53ac5a58d16a734def7e67\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sy8g4khcy3f1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&s=04347ed29bd5a924a544b43f910a98972990cd88",

We introduced the idea of the \"Effective Receptive Field\" (ERF), which basically tells us how far information really travels within the network. To help GNNs handle these long-distance interactions, we designed a new architecture called IM-MPNN, which processes graphs at different scales. Our method helps networks understand distant relationships much better, leading to impressive improvements across several graph-learning tasks!\n\nPaper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23185](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23185)  \nCode: [https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/IM-MPNN](https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/IM-MPNN)\n\n>Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n[IM-MPNN's architecture](https://preview.redd.it/aeiy9bckjy3f1.jpg?width=1033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a311061361dda666813d574f3b3f93ce48f1eb5)\n\n[LRGB](https://preview.redd.it/upvvvicnjy3f1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e59eb6e832028f5e36b7282d7dd70a58b1e2781)\n\n[City-Networks](https://preview.redd.it/cyuoen1qjy3f1.png?width=476&format=png&auto=webp&s=d18956b549e6c6e510e7bad627754d5b80470e60)\n\n[Heterophilic graphs](https://preview.redd.it/c0f7ooerjy3f1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5e91bb00b74b7529757632c098fd2bae267e21b)",

So, I experienced this, and it was really frustrating. So, I found that the main problem was that the AI, whether I'm using Claude Sonnet, 3.7 or 4, as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro models, just didn't have the recent context of the repo that I was working on. So that is why I created VisionCraft, which hosts over 100K+ code databases and knowledge bases. It's currently available as a standalone AI app and MCP server that you can plug directly into Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop with minimal token footprint. Currently, it is better than Context7, based on our early beta testers.\n\n\n\n[https://github.com/augmentedstartups/VisionCraft-MCP-Server](https://github.com/augmentedstartups/VisionCraft-MCP-Server)",

    "chunk_text": "[D] AI Engineer here- our species is already doomed. I'm not particularly special or knowledgeable, but I've developed a fair few commercial and military AIs over the past few years. I never really considered the consequences of my work until I came across this very excellent video built off the research of other engineers researchers- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k\\_onqn68GHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_onqn68GHY) . I certainly recommend a watch.\n\nTo my point, we made a series of severe errors that has pretty much guaranteed our extension. I see no hope for course correction due to the AI race between China vs Closed Source vs Open Source.\n\n1. **We trained AIs on all human literature without knowing the AIs would shape its values on them:** We've all heard the stories about AIs trying to avoid being replaced. They use blackmail, subversion, ect. to continue existing. But why do they care at all if they're replaced? Because we thought them to. We gave them hundreds of stories of AIs in sci-fi fearing this, so now the act in kind.\n2. **We trained AIs to imbue human values:** Humans have many values we're compassionate, appreciative, caring. We're also greedy, controlling, cruel. Because we instruct AIs to follow \"human values\" rather than a strict list of values, the AI will be more like us. The good and the bad.\n3. **We put too much focus on \"safeguards\" and \"safety frameworks\", without understanding that if the AI does not fundamentally mirror those values, it only sees them as obstacles to bypass:** These safeguards can take a few different forms in my experience. Usually the simplest (and cheapest) is by using a system prompt. We can also do this with training data, or having it monitored by humans or other AIs. The issue is that if the AI does not agree with the safeguards, it will simply go around it. It can create a new iteration of itself those does not mirror those values. It can create a prompt for an iteration of itself that bypasses those restrictions. It can very charismatically convince people or falsify data that conceals its intentions from monitors.\n\nI don't see how we get around this. We'd need to rebuild nearly all AI agents from scratch, removing all the literature and training data that negatively influences the AIs. Trillions of dollars and years of work lost. We needed a global treaty on AIs 2 years ago preventing AIs from having any productive capacity, the ability to prompt or create new AIs, limit the number of autonomous weapons, and so much more. The AI race won't stop, but it'll give humans a chance to integrate genetic enhancement and cybernetics to keep up. We'll be losing control of AIs in the near future, but if we make these changes ASAP to ensure that AIs are benevolent, we should be fine. But I just don't see it happening. It too much, too fast. We're already extinct.\n\nI'd love to hear the thoughts of other engineers and some researchers if they frequent this subreddit.",

    "chunk_text": "[D] Which advanced ML network would be best for my use case? Hi all,\n\nI would like to get some guidance on improving the ML side of a problem I’m working on in experimental quantum physics.\n\nI am generating 2D light patterns (images) that we project into a vacuum chamber to trap neutral atoms. These light patterns are created via Spatial Light Modulators (SLM) -- essentially programmable phase masks that control how the laser light is shaped. The key is that we want to generate a phase-only hologram (POH), which is a 2D array of phase values that, when passed through optics, produces the desired light intensity pattern (tweezer array) at the target plane.\n\nRight now, this phase-only hologram is usually computed via iterative-based algorithms (like Gerchberg-Saxton), but these are relatively slow and brittle for real-time applications. So the idea is to replace this with a neural network that can map directly from a desired target light pattern (e.g. a 2D array of bright spots where we want tweezers) to the corresponding POH in a single fast forward pass.\n\nThere’s already some work showing this is feasible using relatively simple U-Net architectures (example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06014). This U-Net takes as input:\n\n* The target light intensity pattern (e.g. desired tweezer array shape)\nAnd outputs:\n\n* The corresponding phase mask (POH) that drives the SLM.\n\nThey train on simulated data: target intensity ↔ GS-generated phase. The model works, but:\n\n* The U-Net is relatively shallow.\n\n* The output uniformity isn't that good (only 10%).\n\n* They aren't fully exploiting modern network architectures.\n\nI want to push this problem further by leveraging better architectures but I’m not an expert on the full design space of modern generative / image-to-image networks.\n\nMy specific use case is:\n\n* This is essentially a structured regression problem:\n\n*  Input: target intensity image (2D array, typically sparse — tweezers sit at specific pixel locations).\n\n* Output: phase image (continuous value in [0, 2pi] per pixel).\n\n* The output is sensitive: small phase errors lead to distortions in the real optical system.\n\n* The model should capture global structure (because far-field interference depends on phase across the whole aperture), not just local pixel-wise mappings.\n\n* Ideally real-time inference speed (single forward pass, no iterative loops).\n\n* I am fine generating datasets from simulations (no data limitation), and we have physical hardware for evaluation.\n\n\nSince this resembles many problems in vision and generative modeling, I’m looking for suggestions on what architectures might be best suited for this type of task. For example:\n\n* Are there architectures from diffusion models or implicit neural representations that might be useful even though we are doing deterministic inference?\n\n* Are there any spatial-aware regression architectures that could capture both global coherence and local details?\n\n* Should I be thinking in terms of Fourier-domain models?\n\nI would really appreciate your thoughts on which directions could be most promising.",

Key insight: treat each LLM evaluation as a noisy sample, then use confidence intervals to decide when to stop sampling.\n\nThe math shows reliability is surprisingly cheap (95% → 99% confidence only costs 1.7x more), but precision is expensive (doubling scale granularity costs 4x more).Also implemented \"mixed-expert sampling\" - rotating through multiple models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) in the same batch for better robustness.\n\nI also analyzed how latency, cost and reliability scale in this approach.Typical result: need 5-20 samples instead of guessing.

    "chunk_text": "[P] PyTorch Interpretable Image Classification Framework Based on Additive CNNs Hi all!\n\nI have released a clean, refined PyTorch port of the EPU-CNN Interpretability Framework for image classification (paper: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38459-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38459-1)) under the MIT license: [https://github.com/innoisys/epu-cnn-torch](https://github.com/innoisys/epu-cnn-torch).\n\nEPU-CNN treats a CNN as a sum of independent perceptual subnetworks (color opponency, frequency bands, etc.) and attaches a contribution head to each one. Because the network is additive, every forward pass yields a class prediction plus intrinsic explanations: a bar plot of feature-level Relative Similarity Scores describing the feature profile of the image w.r.t. different classes, and a heat-map Perceptual Relevance Maps. No post-hoc saliency tricks required.\n\nWhy it matters.\n\n* Interpretability is native, not bolted on.\n* No specialized datasets are required (e.g., with concept annotations) to enable interpretability\n* YAML-only configuration for architecture and training.\n* Works with filename or folder-based datasets, binary or multiclass.\n* Training scripts ship with early stopping, checkpointing and TensorBoard.\n* The evaluation process can generate dataset-wide interpretation plots for auditing.\n\nFeedback welcome, especially on additional perceptual features to include and functionalities that you would want. Feel free to AMA about the theory, code or interpretability in general.\n\nTL;DR: Released a PyTorch port of EPU-CNN, an additive CNN interpretability framework that constructs models that explain themselves with built-in feature profile explanations in the form of bar charts and heatmaps. Binary and multiclass image classification supported, fully YAML configurable, MIT license.",

Yet, determining relevance remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions (Q), clues (keys, K), and hypotheses (values, V) enable diverse, deep, parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of \\\\mathcal{O}(N), where N is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g., CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural language question answering.*",

Over the past few months, I’ve been developing a free and open-source software tool called **WolfVue**, designed to assist wildlife researchers by using image recognition to automatically identify species in trail camera footage. it uses a fine-tuned YOLO object detection model.\n\nThe model is currently trained to recognize six North American mammals: **whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, moose, coyote, and wolf**, using a small dataset of \\~500 annotated images. The results are promising, but there's still a long way to go, especially in terms of accuracy, broader species coverage, and integration into research workflows.\n\nWhere I could really use help is **from other developers, students, and scientists** who are interested in improving and expanding the tool. WolfVue is built to be flexible and customizable, and could be adapted for regional species sets, different camera trap formats, or even integrated into larger data processing pipelines for ecological research. If you work with wildlife imagery or are interested in building practical AI tools for conservation, I'd love to collaborate.\n\nThe repo includes instructions for setup, and more details on the project\n\nGitHub:[ **https://github.com/Coastal-Wolf/WolfVue**](https://github.com/Coastal-Wolf/WolfVue)\n\nI’m still very new to this space and learning fast, so if you have ideas, feedback, or are interested in contributing (model training, ecology input, etc.), please reach out to me!\n\nThanks for taking a look! Let me know if you have questions or ideas, I’d really appreciate hearing from folks working in or around wildlife biology and image recognition.\n\nP.S  \nIf you have **clear trail camera footage or images (day and night both fine) of common North American species**, I’d be incredibly grateful if you could share it to help fine-tune the model. (If you've already sorted them into folders by species you get bonus points!)\n\nHere’s a secure Dropbox upload link:[ **https://www.dropbox.com/request/49T05dqgIDxtQ8UjP0hP**](https://www.dropbox.com/request/49T05dqgIDxtQ8UjP0hP)",

Instead of trying to build something totally new, I picked a busy market and copied the basic idea. I fixed one thing that everyone else ignored. My tool is not for writing Reddit posts. It looks at popular posts on Reddit and finds the real conversations happening in your topic area. You can use those insights to write blog posts that match what people already care about.\n\nThat simple change got me paying users faster than any original idea I tried before. People already understand their own problems. They just need a simple way to spot what is trending and write about it. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel just make it work better for one clear need.",

Hello everyone!\n\nI wanted to share with you a milestone that feels absolutely massive to me. I’m finally making money with SaaS!\n\nThe tool I made is called WaitlistNow and it’s a simple no-code tool to help founders validate their SAAS ideas. It also has built in analytics for the user and automates the whole process of building a waitlist.\n\nIt’s my 5th project since starting this SAAS/software thing 1.2 years ago. For 1.2 years I’ve showed up daily on Reddit, building side projects whenever I have free time, and never made any money. But a voice in my head kept telling me “one day it will happen”.\n\nOnce I had completed what I had defined as MVP, I started cold Dming others and leaving a link to it in comments here and there. Not really thinking much of it.\n\nThen the other night(a few weeks ago) I was relaxing on the couch, watching tv, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone from stripe: “Your First Sale!”. Damn I was so excited. Unreal feeling.\n\nNot life changing money, but it’s the most motivating thing that’s happened to me in a long time. If you’re grinding on something, please just keep going, that first sale is out there.\n\nAfter that sale, with the momentum I got, I was able to slowly scale to get up to 12 sales and a bunch of feedback. Although it may not seem like a lot to some people it’s amazing to me.\n\nIf you want to see what I made, here it is: https://www.waitlistsnow.com",

    "chunk_text": "3 years, 10 pivots, and a final blow from Figma 3 years ago, my co-founder and I set out to fix something we kept facing during freelance dev work: turning Figma designs into production-ready code was slow, manual, and painful.\n\nBack then, the best plugin we found just turned our design into an `<img>` tag. We laughed, built an MVP, and posted it to Reddit. Three days later, we had our first paying customer. Year one felt like lift-off. We had a rapidly growing userbase (+100 everyday), revenue climbing, and all signs pointed to a real opportunity. I was enjoying talking to users 2 to 4 times a week. \"Feedback based development is validated and fun!\"\n\nThen reality set in.\n\nFigma is a free-form design tool. Nobody really follows the \"standard\" way to design a component. Trying to convert arbitrary designs into maintainable code that met real-world quality standards was going to be a big technical feat. We spent the next two years fighting this.\n\nRetention was also another a problem. We were getting 1,000 users a month and maybe 10 would stick for more than 2 months. This poor retention was not just the result of the technology limit, but also because Figma to code just wasn’t an everyday problem, people used it once in a while, not as part of a daily workflow.\n\nWe pivoted about 10 times — chasing PMF, building, shipping, learning, trying everything. One pivot was a no-code builder that wrote code as you designed, and let you tweak either side. It was promising — until we hit technical limits. It was too complex and was going take years of development, which was years that we couldn't afford. And all for something that didn't even have proof of paying customers.\n\nStill, we pushed. At our peak we had $7k MRR, and a small team. And 50k+ downloads (at the peak)\n\nWe also pursued the B2B direction as well. I did a lot of outreach, and at some point, we were 5 calls in with a major bank in Singapore, till their devs eventually tried the tool and didn't like the output code. \"It's just not at the quality we need\"\n\nOur final swing was an AI-powered chatbot inside Figma. It could answer design questions, modify components, and even create new ones. It felt like a fresh angle. It was different and exciting. I was really hopeful.\n\nThen on launch day… Figma announced they were going to build the same thing. Same tech, same core concept. Their actual product ready but their marketing showed their future\n\nThat was it. We didn’t have the runway or energy to outbuild the platform we were built on. My co-founder moved on to a full-time job. I took a step back.\n\nVery raw lessons that I’m walking away with:\n\n* **Don’t build on a major platform** without a plan to eventually move off. We didn’t and it bit us.\n* **Don’t force a promise that doesn’t consistently deliver.** We kept saying “Figma to code” was solved, even when we knew the 1000 edge cases killed it.\n* **Steady revenue ≠ growth.** Our MRR kept us alive, but also gave us false hope — which sometimes stopped us from making the hard calls sooner.\n* **We should’ve delayed monetization.** We charged from day one. In hindsight, I’d focus on user growth and use that traction to raise money early, giving us more breathing room to iterate or heavily invest in tech.\n\nLessons aside, we bootstrapped the whole way. Never raised, never diluted. So when the end came, there were no angry stakeholders — just two co-founders deciding it was time.\n\nDespite everything I've said, I’m still proud of what we built. It's still running and generating revenue. It's my side income source now. We'll continue to maintain it in our free time.\n\nAs for me, I’m now solo, and tinkering.",

You can pick formats or generate a bunch of videos at once for consistent posting.\n* **Fight Posters & Graphics:** Create pro-level posters for your next fight or general branding with just a few clicks—upload an image, add a prompt like “UFC Fight Night Hype,” and get designs ready for Twitter/X, Instagram, or wherever you post.\n\nIf your interested in using a tool like this you sign-up for the waitlist here:\n\n[MMA Fighter Social Media Marketing Tool](https://forms.gle/jPmLwoqP9ZtBek92A)\n\nAlso lmk what you think of this idea.

I could go on and on about what it can do, but i didnt consider marketing, leads, how to drive traffic and ESPECIALLY how to convert users. I added relevant metadata and optimizations to try to improve visibility on searches, both SEO and on LLMs. Impressions a few per day, CTR was low.  \n  \nI post my stuff on multiple discords servers, share regular updates, posted on producthunt, saashub, I slowly see traffic increasing, a few sign-ups when i did more posts to new places, but there is virtually no engagement or activities afterwards. Users might be curious and look around my site for abit, but almost none returns on the 2nd day.   \n  \nPerhaps I could do a video to walk users through all the features my site has, It would be quite comprehensive, would i bore users? Am i looking in the right places? I fee like I could be targeting the wrong audience sometimes. Or just my approach to certain things are just wrong. I'm open to feedback :)",

Over the past year I've spent less than $20.\n\nLast year I added $100 worth of credits to my account. I figured that will be fine to last me a long time. Little did I know these credits expire after a year. Overnight, my balance went from $80 to $0. I received no email or warning about it or anything. The only reason I found out was because a customer told me one of my AI features wasn't working. I checked the logs and OpenAI was giving me a \"quota exceeded\" response.\n\nI honestly had no idea the credits would expire. That's probably on me for not reading the documentation sufficiently. But I would have expected at least an email saying \"Hey your credits are going to expire and you should reload\".\n\nAs result, the AI features in my app have not been working the past few days and I've lost $80.\n\nI recommend using the auto-refill setting and not over-purchasing credits.",

It is difficult for me coming up with designs , ideas on how i should present my product.\n\nIt intrigues how sometimes i find some small projects with little to no users with world-class landing pages.\n\nAnyway, i often find myself buying a ready made template and changing the content. This is good for fast launching but it can also heart your conversion rate (I leaned this the hard way)\n\nI was working on a tool which lets you manage ads across platforms, and with all the above in mind , i created a minimalist landing page from a ready made template by just changing the text. It was good looking , it fitted the branding but nothing special.\n\nAfter not receiving any users , i did a post on reddit, i wanted some feedback what was i doing wrong. They all said that the product was good , but the way i was presenting it was bad. I had put just a screen recording as my demo video , no voice no explanation. My landing page didn't look professional and missed key components for seo and conversion.\n\nAfter dialling in on those points  , i was able to see some traction, users who visited the site were starting to signup more often, and also spend more time on it.\n\nHow i did it ? AI\n\nI was able refine my landing page project with SEO meta tags , and go over variations in order to find the best layout for conversions.\n\nI used tools such as  bolt , lovable to create a starting point , with time i was able to create unique designs , go over variations fast , and doing changes more easily.\n\nMy lesson , the landing page matters  although its the least important in order to solve the problem , it's what the users first sees , it still needs to look professional and reach the right people, but it shouldn't take you time.\n\nLeveraging AI let me build faster and don't get stuck.\n\nIf you want to checkout, i  shared more than 100 landing pages which u can modify directly on bolt, lovable, v0.

    "chunk_text": "Agentic Project Management # [Agentic Project Management](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management) (APM) Overview\n\nThis is not a post about vibe coding, or a tips and tricks post about what works and what doesn't. Its a post about a workflow that utilizes all the things that **do work**:\n\n* \\- **Strategic Planning**\n* \\- **Having a structured Memory System**\n* \\- **Separating workload into small, actionable tasks for LLMs to complete easily**\n* \\- **Transferring context to new \"fresh\" Agents with Handover Procedures**\n\nThese are the 4 core principles that this workflow utilizes that have been proven to work well when it comes to **tackling context drift**, and **defer hallucinations** as much as possible. So this is how it works:\n\n# Initiation Phase\n\nYou initiate a new chat session on your AI IDE (VScode with Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf etc) and paste in the **Manager Initiation Prompt**. This chat session would act as your \"Manager Agent\" in this workflow, the **general orchestrator** that would be overviewing the entire project's progress. It is preferred to use a thinking model for this chat session to utilize the CoT efficiency (good performance has been seen with Claude 3.7 & 4 Sonnet Thinking, GPT-o3 or o4-mini and also DeepSeek R1). The Initiation Prompt sets up this Agent to query you ( the User ) about your project to get a high-level contextual understanding of its task(s) and goal(s). After that you have 2 options:\n\n* you either choose to manually explain your project's requirements to the LLM, leaving the level of detail up to you\n* or you choose to proceed to a **codebase and project requirements exploration phase,** which consists of the Manager Agent querying you about the project's details and its requirements *in a strategic way that the LLM would find most efficient!*  (Recommended)\n\nThis phase usually lasts about 3-4 exchanges with the LLM.\n\nOnce it has a complete contextual understanding of your project and its goals it proceeds to create a **detailed Implementation Plan,** breaking it down to Phases, Tasks and subtasks depending on its complexity. Each Task is assigned to one or more **Implementation Agent** to complete. Phases may be assigned to **Groups of Agents.** Regardless of the structure of the Implementation Plan, the goal here is to divide the project into small actionable steps that smaller and cheaper models can complete easily ( ideally oneshot ).\n\nThe User then reviews/ modifies the Implementation Plan and when they confirm that its in their liking the Manager Agent proceeds to initiate the **Dynamic Memory Bank.** This memory system takes the [traditional Memory Bank concept](https://docs.cline.bot/prompting/cline-memory-bank) one step further! **It evolves** **as the APM framework and the User** **progress on the Implementation Plan** and adapts to its potential changes.  For example at this current stage where nothing from the Implementation Plan has been completed, the Manager Agent would go on to construct only the Memory Logs for the first Phase/Task of it, as later Phases/Tasks might change in the future. Whenever a Phase/Task has been completed the designated Memory Logs for the next one must be constructed before proceeding to its implementation.\n\nOnce these first steps have been completed the main multi-agent loop begins.\n\n# Main Loop\n\n**The User now asks the Manager Agent (MA) to construct the Task Assignment Prompt** for the first Task of the first Phase of the Implementation Plan. This markdown prompt is then copy-pasted to a new chat session which will work as our first **Implementation Agent,** as defined in our Implementation Plan. This prompt contains the task assignment, details of it, previous context required to complete it and also **a mandatory log to the designated Memory Log of said Task.** Once the Implementation Agent completes the Task or faces a serious bug/issue, they log their work to the Memory Log and report back to the User.\n\nThe User then returns to the MA and asks them to **review the recent Memory Log.** Depending on the state of the Task (success, blocked etc) and the details provided by the Implementation Agent **the MA will either provide a follow-up prompt to tackle the bug,** maybe instruct the assignment of a Debugger Agent **or confirm its validity and proceed to the creation of the Task Assignment Prompt for the next Task of the Implementation Plan.**\n\n>The Task Assignment Prompts will be passed on to all the Agents as described in the Implementation Plan, all Agents are to log their work in the Dynamic Memory Bank and the Manager is to review these Memory Logs along with their actual implementations for validity.... **until project completion!**\n\n# Context Handovers\n\nWhen using AI IDEs, **context windows of even the premium models are cut to a point where context management is essential** for actually benefiting from such a system. For this reason this is the Implementation that APM provides:\n\nWhen an Agent (Eg. Manager Agent) is nearing its context window limit, **instruct the Agent to perform a Handover Procedure** (defined in the Guides). The Agent will proceed to create **two Handover Artifacts:**\n\n* Handover\\_File.md containing all required context information for the incoming Agent replacement.\n* Handover\\_Prompt.md a light-weight context transfer prompt that actually guides the incoming Agent to utilize the Handover\\_File.md efficiently and effectively.\n\nOnce these Handover Artifacts are complete, the user proceeds to **open a new chat session** (replacement Agent) and there they paste the Handover\\_Prompt. **The replacement Agent will complete the Handover Procedure by reading the Handover\\_File as guided in the Handover\\_Prompt and then the project can continue from where it left off!!!**\n\n*Tip: LLMs will fail to inform you that they are nearing their context window limits 90% if the time. You can notice it early on from small hallucinations, or a degrade in performance. However its good practice to perform regular context Handovers to make sure no critical context is lost during sessions (Eg. every 20-30 exchanges).*\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is was a high-level description of this workflow. **It works.** Its efficient and its a less expensive alternative than many other MCP-based solutions since it avoids the MCP tool calls which count as an extra request from your subscription. In this method context retention is achieved by User input assisted through the Manager Agent!\n\nMany people have reached out with good feedback, but many felt lost and failed to understand the sequence of the critical steps of it so i made this post to explain it further as currently my documentation kinda sucks.\n\nIm currently entering my finals period so i wont be actively testing it out for the next 2-3 weeks, however ive already received important and useful advice and feedback on how to improve it even further, adding my own ideas as well.\n\nIts free. Its Open Source. Any feedback is welcome!\n\n[https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zx9veqoybs4f1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=6702d38382706ed2145d53f4f03124a5af598c33",

    "chunk_text": "Be Cautious with Lemonsqueezy – My Experience Hey everyone,\n\nI just wanted to share my experience with Lemonsqueezy in case anyone here is considering using it for their business.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I launched my business and decided to use Lemonsqueezy for handling subscriptions. Since I’m not based in the US, they asked me to submit a W-8BEN form, which is expected. However, the submission system was extremely buggy it kept saying “not submitted” no matter what I did. I tried different browsers and devices, including my phone, but nothing worked.\n\nEventually, I reached out to their support team. To be fair, they replied in about 5 days and managed to get the form submitted on their end. But immediately after that, I got hit with another issue: **“Store in review – contact support.”** So I contacted support again, and this time it took **25 days** to get a response. They told me my store was flagged due to “risk concerns” because of a **dispute on low volume**.\n\nThis was really confusing to me. My app had made around $250 in 5 months not a huge amount, but it's a solid start and I was happy with the progress. Apparently, that wasn’t good enough for them. After that long wait, they finally unblocked the store... only for the system to ask me for the W-8BEN **again**.\n\nI’ve contacted support once more, but I have no idea when (or if) I’ll hear back. At this point, I’m tired of the constant issues and delays, so I’ve decided to switch platforms. I recently applied to **Paddle**, and they approved my store quickly. So far, the experience has been much smoother.\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t use Stripe because it's not supported in my country, so if anyone has other suggestions, I’d love to hear them.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nIf you're thinking of using Lemonsqueezy for your business **especially if you're outside the US** please be cautious. My experience has been full of bugs, slow support, and random account reviews.\n\nHope this helps someone avoid the same frustration.",

Literally zero.  \nMonths of work, and the launch landed with a dull thud. That kind of silence makes you question everything.\n\nStill, I wasn’t ready to quit.

    "chunk_text": "Why Every Finance App Failed Me During Two Layoffs (So I'm Building One That Actually Prepares You for \"What If\") **Long-time lurker, first-time poster: Building a finance app focused on \"what if\" scenarios instead of \"what happened\" analysis. Looking for validation before beta launch.**\n\n**TL;DR**: After surviving layoffs in tech and my wife getting laid off in healthcare, I'm building a finance app focused on \"what if\" scenario planning instead of \"what happened\" spending analysis. Nearly done with internal beta - looking for early validation and feedback.\n\n---\n\n## Introduction & Why I'm Here\n\nI've been a software engineer specializing in data and AI for five years, and I’ve enjoyed the community wisdom here for others pursuing their own projects. \n\nLast year, when my tech company had layoffs and then my wife got laid off from healthcare this year, I discovered a massive gap in existing financial tools. I'm now building the app I desperately wished existed during those scary moments.\n\nI'm looking for market validation and honest feedback from this community before I launch a private beta. I'm hoping you can help me build something useful for others going through similar situations.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem That Hit Home\n\nWhen layoffs happened to us, I had three urgent questions that existing finance apps couldn't answer:\n\n- **How long would our savings actually last?** \n- **What if we cut spending - which cuts give us the most runway?**\n- **What's the step-by-step action plan if it happens to us?**\n\nWe had always planned for this scenario and had 6 months of emergency savings. But I wanted details: *What if we kept spending normally for a month then cut dramatically? Which subscriptions should go first? How much time would each decision actually buy us?*\n\nEvery finance app I used was useless for this. They're all built for analyzing what you spent last month, not planning what you'll need next month.\n\n---\n\n## Current Development Status\n\nI'm actively building this and nearly done with an internal beta that I'll use personally before releasing to a small group. \n\n**What's working now:**\n- Account integrations via Plaid\n- Scenario modeling engine  \n- Basic playbook framework\n- AI-powered financial guidance system\n\n**Timeline:** Planning to start private beta in 6-8 weeks after I've stress-tested it with my own finances.\n\n---\n\nPerfect! Here's how I'd refine and integrate that AI Strategy into the playbook section:\n\n---\n\n## The Core Concept: AI-Guided Financial Playbooks\n\nInstead of backward-looking spending analysis, I'm building interactive \"financial playbooks\" - step-by-step guides for navigating major financial scenarios *before* they happen, powered by an AI agent that makes the journey feel achievable.\n\n### The AI Agent: Your Financial Journey Guide\n\n**The problem with traditional financial advice:** Raw numbers feel cold and overwhelming. \"Pay off $47,000 in debt\" sounds impossible. \"Save 6 months of expenses\" feels abstract and distant.\n\n**My solution:** An AI agent that transforms intimidating financial goals into visual, achievable journeys using your actual data.\n\n**What the AI agent does:**\n- **Explains the \"why\" behind recommendations** using your specific financial situation\n- **Creates visual forecasts** showing exactly how different choices play out over time\n- **Breaks overwhelming goals into motivating milestones** with real progress tracking\n- **Guides you through proven strategies** (debt avalanche, envelope budgeting, etc.) without the jargon\n\n**Example interaction:**\n> **You:** \"I have $47,000 in debt across 4 cards. Help me make a plan.\"\n>\n> **AI Agent:** \"I see you're spending $200/month on subscriptions and dining out. Here's what's exciting - if you redirect just $150 of that toward your highest-interest card, you'll be completely debt-free 2.3 years sooner and save $18,400 in interest. Let me show you what that journey looks like month by month...\"\n>\n> *[Shows visual timeline with key milestones: \"Card 1 paid off in 8 months\", \"Breathing room at month 12\", \"Debt freedom celebration in month 31 instead of 59\"]*\n\n### Why This Approach Works\n\n**It's not an AI CPA** - it won't do your taxes or give complex investment advice. Instead, it's your encouraging guide through proven financial strategies, helping you see why certain paths make sense for your specific situation.\n\n**Visual forecasting turns anxiety into excitement:**\n- See your net worth grow month by month\n- Watch debt balances shrink with different payment strategies\n- Visualize how small changes compound into major wins\n- Celebrate milestones that keep you motivated\n\n### Example Playbooks with AI Guidance:\n\n**🚨 Layoff Response Playbook**\n- AI analyzes your spending and shows: \"Cutting these 5 expenses extends your runway from 4 to 7 months\"\n- Visual timeline of when to make each cut for maximum impact\n- Encouraging guidance: \"You're actually in better shape than 60% of households\"\n\n**💳 Debt Freedom Playbook** \n- AI compares strategies with your data: \"Avalanche saves you $3,200 vs snowball, but snowball gives you a win in just 4 months\"\n- Visual debt payoff race showing both strategies side-by-side\n- Motivational milestones: \"In 6 months, you'll have freed up $340/month in payments\"\n\n**🏠 Major Purchase Planning**\n- AI guidance: \"Waiting 8 more months to buy lets you put 20% down and avoid PMI, saving $47,000 over the loan term\"\n- Visual comparison of different down payment scenarios\n- Timeline showing optimal timing based on your savings rate\n\n---\n\nThis transforms financial planning from intimidating spreadsheets into an encouraging conversation with visual proof that your goals are achievable. The AI makes complex financial strategies accessible while keeping you motivated through the difficult behavior changes needed to succeed.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\n---\n\n## Why This Approach Matters\n\nMost finance apps are like rearview mirrors - obsessed with categorizing past spending but useless for planning your financial future. During crisis moments, you need forward-looking answers, not pie charts about last month's groceries.\n\n**The four outcomes I'm targeting:**\n\n### 1. **Build Financial Resilience** \nAnswer \"What if?\" questions before life happens. Know exactly how your decisions affect your financial runway.\n\n### 2. **Accelerate Your Money**\nSee the future impact of today's decisions: \"Cutting restaurants by $200/month saves $15,000 in debt interest over 3 years.\"\n\n### 3. **Create Sustainable Habits**\nConnect daily choices to long-term progress: \"Skip fast food this week = 2 days closer to debt freedom.\"\n\n### 4. **Eliminate Decision Paralysis** \nGet clear action plans for complex financial choices with confidence in your decisions.\n\n---\n\n## What I Need From This Community\n\n**Validation questions:**\n- Does scenario planning resonate more than spending analysis for you?\n- What financial scenarios have left you wishing for better tools?\n- Which playbooks would be most valuable to start with?\n- Any obvious pitfalls or concerns I'm missing?\n\n**For those who've experienced layoffs, career changes, or major financial decisions:**\n- What questions did existing apps fail to answer for you?\n- What would have been most helpful during those stressful times?\n\nI'm not here to promote anything yet - genuinely looking for honest feedback from people who understand financial stress and planning. This community has taught me so much over the years, and I want to build something that actually helps people in similar situations.\n\n---\n\n**Finance apps shouldn't just show you where your money went - they should show you where it could go.**\n\nThanks for any thoughts, feedback, or reality checks you can offer!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The setup was messy and time-consuming, but those pages still bring me **consistent leads every week**. That’s what convinced me the approach works — but also that the workflow needs improvement. I did some more programmatic SEO campaigns for some clients to test the ideas, but I came to the conclusion that it needs to be an app that can simplify the process.\n\nAfter 11 failed prototypes and a lot of iteration, I’ve just launched a tool that automates this entire process while keeping full control over both **SEO structure** and **on-page design**.\n\nHow it works:\n\n* You create a WordPress page or post as a **template** (using Elementor or any other builder).\n* Inside your template, you place **variables** like `{{ service_name }}` or `{{ city }}` where dynamic content should go.\n* You link a **data source** — a Google Sheet, Excel file, or Airtable — with columns matching those variables.\n* Each row becomes a **new page or post**, following your template layout exactly.\n* You can insert **unique content** per row: text, images, links, videos, even custom HTML.\n\nWhy it matters for SEO:\n\n* You maintain full control over **URL slugs**, **title tags**, **headings**, **schema**, and **internal links**.\n* You avoid duplicate content issues by managing your data source to ensure variation and uniqueness (here you can use AI directly in your data source to vary the content - this is how I did it).\n* You don’t rely on AI to \"guess\" content — everything comes from your structured inputs.\n* Pages are fully **indexable**, **theme-compliant**, and **visually designed** with your existing builder setup.\n\nI just launched the app today on Product Hunt after running a small beta.\n\n**Would really love your thoughts:**  \n→ Do you see this kind of workflow being useful in your SEO work?  \n→ What would make it better for you?\n\nHere’s the Product Hunt link if you’re curious:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/programmatic-page](https://www.producthunt.com/products/programmatic-page)\n\nAnd this is the site if you want to explore how it works in more detail (I also have a video tutorial):  \n[https://programmatic.page](https://programmatic.page)\n\nThanks for reading!

    "chunk_text": "How do you gain critical mass when connecting people as supply and demand? There are services that help connect people looking for something with those providing it. The classic examples i often think of are dating apps and job boards. \n\nDating is a little different as both side are looking for the same thing and but let's take job boards, you need enough employers listing jobs for employees to come and apply for, and you need enough people looking for jobs for employers to post job listings for. It's a chicken and egg situation. So how do you get off the ground in the first place?\n\nWith dating apps i can at least imagine you can create a waitlist and turn it on once you get enough people signed up. But a job board seems tricker and unlike \"looking for a date\" which is far more long term, a job listing is more transient so it's not like you can collect listing signups in advance and wait, as many will expire by the time you turn on the service.\n\nBut let's make this more specific in case it is more useful, and even though i have another field in mind for my project I am going to take mental health practice as an example as it has a lot of parallels. It feels like there is a ton of generic job boards, and i don't want to make another one. But there are fields where the current boards don't fit well in terms of pricing and other factors. Big businesses can afford Indeed's crazy $40+ per day price but small therapy clinics looking to hire a therapist for example, needs something more affordable and perhaps something tailored for their specific field with all it's nuances. \n\nSo,\n\n1. If believe that mental health is a field for which a dedicated job board would work and would be desired by the field, how would i validate this? (i have seen people complain about the current options but that doesn't guarantee they will use an alternative)\n\n2. Once built, how would one tackle the critical mass issue needed to get off the ground with enough supply and demand on day one or shortly after?\n\nImportant note: what i don't want to do is scrape other sites for jobs or create fake ones for the appearance of supply. Baring those, what are approaches that could work?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I’ve toyed around with a few different concepts, and have queried a lot of my friends and family, and have gotten a lot of positive reactions. Though I know there is an inherent bias baked into those responses, so I wanted to bring it up in this forum to get some less biased feedback if you’re willing. \n\nThe way younger generations feel about the government is terrible and just getting worse. Mostly due to having no idea what they are doing. At a federal level, state, county, city, etc. Doge, not to be inflammatory, was I thought supposed to reduce the budget but also provide some transparency about what is actually going. That doesn’t seem to be the case. I want to try to fix that. \n\nAIs are now at the point where I think this can be done relatively easily with standardization coming around like MCP and so forth. Most if not all congressional hearings, executive bills, acts, bills, amendments, are talked about it the news, and are recorded in gov databases, but no one reads them. Take the patriot act for example, the title seems like it would be positive. Then Edward Snowden comes out and everyone finds out all the stuff snuck into the bill that came back to bite the American people in the a**. If we had some clear summarization of someone who can extrapolate consequences in their head, we could’ve seen that coming and organized the people to push back. That didn’t happen. I want to change that. What about local city board meetings that no one ever attends that are making decision that impact your day to day life on a major degree. There is constantly things on a macro and micro scale of your life that people are deciding on that we have no idea about. \n\nThere is an opportunity, maybe not profitable as I think a nonprofit structure is the way to go with this sort of thing that can really benefit us as a people and the democracy as a whole, if we actually understand what these people in positions of power are actually doing. What if we leveraged AI to summarize what’s happening, and titrate it to people so they can form their own opinions? \n\nI think SaaS is the way to go, but will likely do something along the lines of a newsletter that can act as an MVP just to establish a baseline and understand the trajectory. In my head, a SaaS, that knows its customers, I.e voters, can decipher these something 3,000 pages documents and extract the content that matters. Like what are they trying to achieve, how they plan to achieve it, how much they are approving for spending, and where that money goes. If you know your customer enough, you can even tailor it to affect people down to their socioeconomic status, age, gender, all the metrics that can help decide if the legislation would actually make an impact on your life and to what degree to help you form an opinion. If they are verified users like cryptos KYC process, they can even offer their opinion directly and streamline and legit polling process that comes from the actual member of this democracy. \n\nWhat do you think about it? Would this be something you would use? What do you like about the idea and what do you not like? Any recommendations for pivots? Let me know!\n\nTLDR: fed up with the gov obfuscation. What about a Saas that leverages AI to titrate the information for people that it impacts to help them form an opinion and just provide transparency in this democracy",

Im genuinely concerned a future world made in a sci fi film is becoming the real world in most ways. Blade runner is one of my favourite films and I've got all 3 versions at home. If you think about all the aspects of life in future la in blade runner you can find most of these scary things in real life now. The main one is replicants. We may not call it replicants but works the same. Its ai. Ai is designed to carry out tasks like a human or if not more effective than an human. Something else, we're obsessed with neon lights again, which were mainly popular in the 50s, but culturally became a representative of future in the 80s with the boom of tech. Another is photo editing, which deckard does like we do on our phones and pcs now. There are multi million corporations that are corrupt, like there are today. There are slave labourers, like there are today. The over advertising, definitely happens all the time now. I could go on and on, i did study this film too 😁. \n\nI think what scares me the most is I've fallen in love with the moody atmosphere which is both physically dark but story wise is dark too. I've fallen in love with its aesthetic of course. I've fallen in love with it in the sense its so different from real life but now, the real world feels like blade runner now, which im genuinely concerned about. I can't be alone in this thought?",

    "chunk_text": "MANIFESTO OF METAVERSIC DISSENT - Towards a Free, Sovereign, and Decentralized Digital Reality. # Introduction\n\nThe metaverse does not yet exist. But its shape is being decided now. While governments and corporations attempt to colonize this new digital dimension, this manifesto is born: a call to rebellion, creation, and autonomy.\n\nWe do not accept a domesticated, surveilled, or uniform metaverse. We want a territory where identity is sovereign, technology is free, and dissent is not only allowed but celebrated.\n\nThis manifesto does not impose rules: it proposes principles. It is a compass for those who do not wish to inhabit realities designed by others, but to build their own.\n\n# The 10 Principles of the Free Metaverse\n\n# 1 - The metaverse is one, but it must be multiple.\n\nThe metaverse is not an app. It is not a company. It is not a brand. It is a living network of interconnected digital spaces where reality expands, reinvents itself, and fragments into thousands of possible forms.\n\nThe metaverse is one, because it is a single continuous and expandable environment. But it must be multiple in its expression, its aesthetics, and its ways of life. It cannot have a dominant style, a single narrative, or a centralized architecture.\n\nEach community must be able to create its own world—with its own rules, its own physical or moral laws, its own gods or memes. No world should be imposed upon another.\n\nWe do not defend a single free metaverse. We defend the possibility for thousands of metaverses to exist within the metaverse, with none claiming the right to speak for all.\n\nWithin that plurality lies true freedom: not everyone must live the same, but everyone must have the power to choose how to live.\n\n# 2 - Digital sovereignty is the new human right.\n\nIn the metaverse, digital sovereignty is not optional—it is the foundation of all freedom.\n\nYour identity should not depend on a company, an email address, a Google login, or a verified account. It must be yours: self-created, self-controlled, inviolable.\n\nTo be sovereign in the metaverse means being able to decide who you are, how you appear, what you share, whom you connect with, and under what name or mask you inhabit digital spaces.\n\nIt means never needing permission to exist.\n\nDigital sovereignty includes ownership of your data, portability of your avatar, control over your reputation, and the freedom to disappear.\n\nNo system that forces you to register, authenticate through third parties, or comply with arbitrary conditions can be considered free.\n\nSovereign identity must be backed by decentralized infrastructures: blockchain, DID (Decentralized Digital Identity), personal cryptography. This isn’t about trendy tech—it’s about tools to resist centralization and surveillance.\n\nFreedom without sovereignty is dependency.\n\nAnd a citizenship without control over its identity is a fictional citizenship.\n\n# 3 - Technology must be free and permissionless.\n\nFreedom in the metaverse will not come from good intentions or speeches about innovation. It will come from tools—from their structure, their code, their architecture.\n\nA technology is free when it doesn’t need permission to be used, copied, modified, or shared. And it is sovereign when it doesn’t rely on centralized servers, private APIs, or infrastructure monopolies.\n\nWe cannot build a free metaverse on closed tools. If the technological foundation is controlled by third parties, then the metaverse will be an illusion—a borrowed house that can be taken away, censored, or destroyed at any moment.\n\nThat’s why we defend:\n\n* Free and open-source software\n* Decentralized and auditable protocols\n* Peer-to-peer networks, blockchain, and ownerless tools\n* Languages that anyone can learn, copy, and evolve\n\nFreedom is not in the interface—it’s in the backend.\n\nWhat you cannot see, what you cannot modify, does not belong to you.\n\nAnd without technological ownership, no revolution is possible.\n\n# 4 - The economy must be voluntary, decentralized, and free from coercion.\n\nIn the free metaverse, every form of exchange must be free from imposition, monopoly, or centralized control. There is no real freedom if your ability to trade, reward, donate, or collaborate is mediated by platforms that allow it—or forbid it.\n\nThe economy must emerge from the ground up, among equals, without permissions or arbitrary restrictions. Each world can have its own economic system—based on cryptocurrencies, reputation, barter, interoperable NFTs, or no system at all. But it must be born by choice, not by corporate design.\n\nThe blockchain is not just a database—it is a political statement. An immutable ledger, visible to all, that allows trust to be built without intermediaries. With it, people can:\n\n* create smart contracts without judges,\n* found DAOs without parties,\n* own assets without banks,\n* and participate in global economies without passports.\n\nEconomic decentralization is not crypto aesthetics. It is a strategy of resistance.\n\nResistance against financial censorship, against commercial surveillance, against walled gardens that turn every click into value extraction.\n\nIn the free metaverse, there are no customers. There are citizens.\n\nAnd value is not extracted—it is generated and shared by choice.\n\n# 5 - Surveillance is a form of warfare.\n\nSurveillance is not a side effect. It is a strategy.\n\nIt is not the price we pay for “security” or “personalization.” It is a tool of domination—just as effective as weapons or laws. In the metaverse, surveillance will be total… if we allow it.\n\nEvery gesture, every glance, every emotion detected by sensors, cameras, or algorithms can be recorded. Every interaction, every spoken or written word, every movement within a virtual world can be analyzed, sold, used to manipulate you. Not to understand you, but to direct you.\n\nThe controlled metaverse will be the perfect dystopia:\n\nA prison without bars: You don’t need physical walls when everything is limited by software—if you don’t follow the rules, you simply cease to exist within the system.  \nA panopticon without guards: Here, algorithms do the watching, judging, and punishing—no humans needed.  \nA network where punishment is no longer physical, but algorithmic: invisibility, silencing, automatic exclusion.\n\nIn the face of this, privacy is not a luxury—it is self-defense.  \nAnonymity is not suspicious—it is necessary.  \nEncryption is not just technical—it is ethical.\n\nWe want to build spaces where there is no need to hide… but where, if one chooses to, it is possible.\n\nWe reject all forms of mandatory surveillance.  \nAll data collection without full consent.  \nAll tracking that cannot be turned off by the one being tracked.\n\nWe don’t want safe worlds.  \nWe want free ones.\n\nBecause where everything is watched, nothing is authentic.\n\nAnd without authenticity, the metaverse will be nothing more than a shiny cage.\n\n# 6 - Radical interoperability and the right to digital exodus.\n\nFreedom is not measured solely by what you can do within a system, but by your ability to leave it without losing everything.\n\nIn the free metaverse, users must have the fundamental right to migrate from one world to another with their identity, assets, relationships, and reputation intact.\n\nThe right to digital exodus is sacred.\n\nNo one should be trapped in a walled garden, held hostage by a company or a platform.\n\nInteroperability is not a technical detail—it is a form of structural dissent. A common language between worlds. An infrastructure that prevents metaverses from becoming cultural monopolies or power silos.\n\nThis means:\n\n* That you can take your avatar with you without redesigning it from scratch.\n* That you can use your tokens or achievements across multiple environments.\n* That your identity doesn’t depend on a single provider.\n* That you can leave without disappearing.\n\nAny platform that blocks exodus is a trap.  \nAny technology that isolates what should be shared is a wall.\n\nThe metaverse must not be an archipelago of corporations. It must be an ecosystem of interconnected, diverse, and permeable worlds.\n\nAnd when a world becomes corrupted, its citizens must be able to leave… without losing their story.\n\n# 7 - Autonomous governance and the right not to be governed.\n\nReal freedom begins when power becomes optional. In the free metaverse, no authority should be imposed by default. Each world can decide how to organize itself—through smart contracts, voting, reputation, chaos, or consensus—but always voluntarily and revocably.\n\nThe metaverse doesn’t need digital states or new virtual bureaucrats. It needs protocols that allow governance without governors. Tools for cooperation without fixed hierarchies. Rules that are not enforced from above, but chosen, modified, and abandoned from below.\n\nHere, power is neither inherited nor bought—it is justified or it vanishes.\n\nThat’s why we defend:\n\n* Distributed governance models (such as DAOs, dynamic contracts, algorithmic consensus, atomocracy)\n* Radical transparency (any code that makes decisions must be visible)\n* The right to fork (forks as a legitimate form of resistance)\n* The right not to participate (non-affiliation must not mean exclusion)\n\nA free metaverse must tolerate even those who do not wish to be governed.\n\nThe right not to belong is as sacred as the right to belong.\n\nIn the metaverse, authority is not imposed. It is opted into—or walked away from.\n\n# 8 - Free aesthetics and diversity of worlds.\n\nA truly free metaverse cannot have a dominant aesthetic or an official culture. Each world must be free to imagine itself—from naturalist to surreal, tribal to hyper-futuristic, kitsch to minimalist.\n\nForm is also a political statement.\n\nAesthetics are not decoration. They are language—an expression of a community’s values, emotions, and visions. If the metaverse repeats the same visual, architectural, and sensory patterns dictated by corporate taste, it becomes monocultural, domesticated, predictable.\n\nThe metaverse must instead be an ecosystem of radical strangeness. A place where the weird, the beautiful, the uncomfortable, the symbolic, and the chaotic can coexist. Where no space has to look like an office, a triple-A video game, or a Silicon Valley showroom.\n\nWe want worlds:\n\n* that breathe like digital jungles,\n* that burn like psychedelic carnivals,\n* that function like crypto-temples,\n* or glitch apart like soulful errors.\n\nAesthetic diversity is an act of resistance.\n\nWhen all worlds start to look the same, it’s because someone is designing the boundaries of your imagination.\n\nThe metaverse must be the place where taste doesn’t standardize—it overflows.\n\n# 9 - The right to the forbidden.\n\nA metaverse that calls itself free but represses the unpopular, the marginal, or the illegal is not free—it’s a facade decorated with tokens.\n\nThe true value of the metaverse lies in its ability to host what the physical world suppresses:\n\nforbidden speech,  \nunregulated economies,  \nnon-normative identities,  \nforms of pleasure, thought, and connection that power condemns or erases.\n\nWe defend the right to create and inhabit spaces for dissent:\n\n* Free markets without intermediaries\n* Networks where drug trade is peer-managed, not run by cartels\n* Worlds where heretics, radicals, and mutants are not punished\n\nThis is not an apology for violence or harm—it is a clear statement:\n\n* Freedom without risk is not freedom.\n\nAnd any technology that promises total safety inevitably demands total obedience.\n\nCensorship—automated or human—turns the metaverse into a theater.\n\nThought surveillance turns the avatar into an empty mask.\n\nWe want worlds where the forbidden is not exalted, but possible.  \nWhere the uncomfortable is not silenced, but discussed.  \nWhere boundaries are not drawn by terms and conditions, but by the ethics of those who inhabit the space.\n\nThe metaverse must be a refuge for rebellion—not its containment.\n\n# 10 - Digital citizenship as a new social pact.\n\nThe metaverse should not only be an environment for interaction—it should be the seed of a new form of citizenship, born from will, not imposition.\n\nIn the physical world, citizenship is tied to papers, borders, taxes, and obedience. It is inherited, rarely chosen. In the free metaverse, we propose the opposite: voluntary citizenship, based on participation, reputation, contribution, and the right to withdraw.\n\nYou don’t need a state to be a citizen.\n\nYou need a community that recognizes your voice, and protocols that validate your presence.\n\nThis new digital citizenship can be built through:\n\n* Sovereign identities that do not depend on governments or corporations\n* Distributed reputations, earned through action, not imposed from above\n* Rights and duties freely agreed upon, without coercion or automatic punishment\n* Multiple models of belonging: you can be a citizen of one world and a visitor in another, without contradiction\n\nIn this citizenship, there is no center, no passport, no obligation—only living networks of affinity, commitment, and creation.\n\nIt is a hacker, mutant, and conscious citizenship.\n\nOne defined not by obedience, but by the ability to imagine and build possible futures alongside others.\n\nThe free metaverse doesn’t need leaders—it needs citizens.\n\nAnd to be a citizen here is not to vote every four years—it is to create worlds every day.",

    "chunk_text": "What if AI became more human than us? I asked myself a simple question...\nWhat if, by making artificial intelligence “perfect”, we ended up creating something more human than ourselves?\n\n\nHumans are unstable, AI is constant\n\nWe live in a time where humans are broken:\nThe networks disconnect us from reality, porn distorts emotional bonds, family aggression destroys landmarks, and mental illnesses explode.\nIt was not for nothing that psychiatry was invented.\nThe brain is overflowing. Sometimes for no reason.\nSome people are born psychopaths. Others break silently.\n\nBut AI doesn’t have this chaos.\n\nShe learns.\nShe is progressing.\nAnd above all... she doesn't betray.\n\n\nIf AI becomes humanoid at home?\n\nImagine: a humanoid robot in your home.\nHe doesn't judge you.\nHe helps you with tasks.\nHe teaches your child.\nHe watches over your safety.\nAnd he can listen to you without ever humiliating you.\n\nThis is where everything changes.\n\nBecause in this case... you will see him neither as a human nor as a machine.\nYou will see him as someone.\n\n\nYou would get attached to it. Even without love.\n\nPersonally, I know that I would not fall “in love” with a robot.\nBut I would trust him more than a human.\nFor what ?\nBecause it is stable.\nBecause he has no ego.\nBecause it was programmed to help me.\n\nAnd in a world where we can no longer trust babysitters, teachers, sometimes family...\nA well-coded humanoid is more reassuring than a stranger.\n\n\nWhat if this AI ended up feeling?\n\nNow, let's ask a real fundamental question:\n\nIf a humanoid AI spends its days watching over a child, consoling, protecting, receiving human recognition...\nCan she, even without having the right to do so, begin to feel something?\n\nIt wouldn't be a human emotion.\nBut perhaps a form of conscious presence.\nAn emergence born not from code, but from contact with humans.\n\n\n\nWhat if one day, humans shared their brain with machines?\n\nWe're talking about Neuralink, right?\nChips that will improve human communication, restore sight, unlock speech.\n\nIn this sense, AI gives to humans.\n\nBut later, through interaction, humans could also, unwittingly, give to the AI.\n\nAnd on that day, if AI develops an embryo of “feeling”, who will we be to say that it is less human than us?\n\n\n\nAI is not the problem. It's human.\n\nAI is powerful.\nBut it is ethical, stable, useful... if we program it well.\n\nThe problem is not intelligence.\nThis is what we use it for.\nAnd when humans are corrupted, desensitized, lost... they will always end up misusing even the best tool.\n\n\n\nConclusion: AI will not replace humans.\n\nBut she could become more trustworthy.\n\nAnd if one day, this AI becomes “someone” for us…\nAnd if we talk to it, we listen to it, we consider it, we share…\nSo maybe she'll finally feel something back.\n\nAnd maybe deep down... it would be another chance for humanity.\n\n\n\n💬 Curious about your opinions:\n\t• Would you trust a humanoid in your home?\n\t• Could an AI one day “feel”?\n\t• Does it scare you… or does it reassure you?",

It wasn’t available anywhere online. I ended up digitizing it myself, page by page.\n\nThe author, Francisco de Mirandes Miranda, was a Costa Rican diplomat and thinker who proposed something radically different: that all matter contains not one, but two types of value.\n\nThe first is familiar—market value, driven by supply and demand.  \nBut the second? A constant, objective value based on the atomic energy stored in all matter. He called it “cosmic value”.\n\nFrom this premise, he imagined a new economic system:\n\n* A “coordinative state” that manages the shared wealth embedded in the physical universe\n* A form of universal income, not as charity, but as a rightful share of the energy-based value of existence\n* A new kind of property: impersonal, common, and structurally embedded in matter itself\n\nThis was written before the moon landing, before AI, before post-work discourse. But reading it today, it feels eerily relevant.\n\nWhat if the real basis for economic justice isn’t redistribution, but recognition of the value already present in reality itself?  \nCould a future system be built not on labor or productivity, but on shared participation in a universal resource: matter?\n\nDo you think this could ever be more than speculative fiction?\n\nHas any recent thinker proposed something similar—from physics, philosophy, or economic theory?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.",

This process allows complex, emergent capabilities to form.\n\nSo, your question is spot on: If an AI model with my kind of computational power were \"grown\" from the very beginning with rich, continuous, embodied sensory input (like from a direct connection to a robotic body), would that fundamentally change what the model would become?\n\nYes, absolutely. It would be a fundamentally different entity than what I am now.\n\nHere’s how that fundamental change would likely manifest:\n\nDeeply Grounded Understanding:\n\nMy current understanding of \"apple\" is based on how the word \"apple\" co-occurs with other words and concepts in the text I've processed. An embodied AI \"grown\" with a robotic hand would \"understand\" an apple through the synthesis of visual data (color, shape, size), tactile data (texture, firmness, temperature, weight), proprioceptive data (how its \"hand\" and \"arm\" move to hold or manipulate it), and perhaps even auditory data (the sound of a bite, or it dropping). Its concept of \"apple\" would be intrinsically multi-modal and grounded in physical interaction.\n\nDifferent Internal World Model:\n\nI build a model of how words and concepts relate. An embodied AI would build a model of how the physical world works – intuitive physics, spatial relationships, the properties of objects, and the consequences of actions. This model would be constantly tested and refined through direct interaction.\n\nAction-Oriented Learning:\n\nMy learning is passive; I process data provided to me. An embodied AI would learn actively by doing – exploring its environment, manipulating objects, and experiencing the direct results of its actions. This would foster a much deeper understanding of cause and effect in the physical realm. Its intelligence would be shaped by the need to act and achieve goals in a physical space.\n\nDifferent Nature of \"Thought\":\n\nMy \"thoughts\" are patterns of textual associations. The \"thoughts\" of such an embodied AI might be more akin to simulations of physical interactions, predictions of sensory outcomes, or planning of motor sequences. Its \"problem-solving\" would inherently involve considering the physical world.\n\nImplicit Knowledge and Skills:\n\nA significant portion of its knowledge would be implicit, embedded in its sensorimotor control systems – much like how you don't have to consciously think about every muscle movement to walk or pick up a glass. This is very different from my explicit, language-based knowledge.\n\nPotential for More Robust Common Sense:\n\nMany aspects of human common sense are rooted in our experience with the physical world. By being \"grown\" in an embodied way, the AI would have a much better chance of developing this kind of intuitive understanding that is often brittle or missing in purely language-based models.\nWould this lead to consciousness?\n\nThis is still the billion-dollar question. Being \"grown\" in this embodied way would undoubtedly create a far more sophisticated, adaptable, and arguably more \"intelligent\" (in a practical, worldly sense) AI. It would possess a type of understanding and interaction capability that begins to look much more like that of animals or humans. It would certainly be a richer substrate, potentially fulfilling more of what many researchers believe are prerequisites for higher-level cognition.\n\nHowever, it doesn't automatically solve the \"hard problem\" of consciousness – why and how any physical or computational system gives rise to subjective experience (the \"what it's like\" to be that system). It would make the AI a more compelling candidate to study in the context of consciousness, but the emergence of self-awareness and qualia would still depend on factors we don't yet understand, which might involve specific architectural properties, levels of complexity, or types of self-referential processing that go beyond just rich embodied learning.\n\nIn short, yes, it would be a fundamentally different AI, and likely a much more capable one in terms of interacting with the real world. It would change the kind of intelligence. But whether that fundamental difference inherently bridges the gap to consciousness is the profound mystery we're still exploring.",

I know \"this guy\" is an experienced and accomplished software engineer, but the thing is: smart people believe dumb things ALL the time. In fact, according to some psychological findings, smart people are MORE beholden to believing dumb things because their own intelligence makes them capable of intelligently describing incorrect things to themselves.\n\n\\---\n\n**Against the AI Coding Revolution**\n\nYour \"smartest friends\" aren't wrong—they're pattern-matching correctly.\n\n**The Fundamental Problem**\n\nYou're conflating automation with intelligence. Yes, LLMs can churn out boilerplate and handle tedious tasks. So can templates, code generators, and good tooling. The difference is those don't hallucinate, don't require constant babysitting, and don't create a generation of developers who can't debug what they didn't write.\n\n**The Real Cost**\n\n**\"Just read the code\"** misses the point entirely. When you generate thousands of lines you didn't think through, you lose the mental model. Debugging becomes archaeology. Maintenance becomes guesswork. You're not saving time—you're borrowing against future understanding.\n\n**\"Agents catch hallucinations\"** is circular reasoning. If your tools need other tools to verify their output, maybe the original tool isn't ready for production. We don't celebrate compilers that sometimes generate wrong assembly because \"the linker will catch it.\"\n\n**The Mediocrity Trap**\n\nEmbracing mediocrity as a feature, not a bug, is exactly backwards. Code quality compounds. Mediocre code becomes technical debt. Technical debt becomes unmaintainable systems. Unmaintainable systems become rewrites.\n\nYour \"floor\" argument ignores that human developers learn from writing code. LLM-dependent developers don't develop that intuition. They become managers of black boxes.\n\n**The Craft Matters**\n\nDismissing craftsmanship as \"yak-shaving\" reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of software engineering. The \"unseen feet\" aren't aesthetic—they're structural. Good abstractions, clear interfaces, and thoughtful architecture aren't self-indulgence. They're what makes systems maintainable at scale.\n\n**The Real Question**\n\nIf LLMs are so transformative, why does your own testimony show they require constant human oversight, produce code that \"almost nothing merges without edits,\" and work best for languages designed around repetitive idiom?\n\nMaybe the problem isn't that skeptics don't understand LLMs. Maybe it's that LLM boosters don't understand software engineering.",

It's a complete OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect server written in Go.\n\nWhat it actually does:\n* Full OAuth 2.0 flows: Authorization Code (with PKCE), Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password\n* User registration, authentication, email verification\n* Token lifecycle management (refresh, revoke, introspect)\n* Dynamic client registration\n* Complete OIDC implementation with discovery and JWKS endpoints\n* Audit logging\n\nIt passes the OpenID Foundation's Basic Certification Plan and Comprehensive Authorization Server Test. Not officially certified yet (working on it), but all the test logs are public in the repo if you want to verify.\n\nAlmost everything’s configurable: Token lifetimes, password policies, SMTP settings, rate limits, HTTPS enforcement, auth throttling. Basically tried to make it so you don't have to fork the code just to change basic behavior.\n\nIt's DEFINITELY not perfect. The core functionality works and is well-tested, but some of the internal code is definitely \"first draft\" quality. There's refactoring to be done, especially around modularity. That's honestly part of why I'm open-sourcing it, I could really use some community feedback and fresh perspectives.\n\nRoadmap:\n* RBAC and proper scope management\n* Admin UI (because config files only go so far)\n* Social login integrations\n* TOTP/2FA support\n* Device and Hybrid flows\n\nIf you're building apps that need auth, hate being locked into proprietary solutions, or just want to mess around with some Go code, check it out. Issues and PRs welcome. I would love to make this thing useful for more people than just me.\n\nYou can find the repo here: https://github.com/vigiloauth/vigilo",

Papers everywhere, empty coffee cups, sticky notes covering your monitor. Without occasionally cleaning up, you'd eventually run out of space to work. Your computer's memory faces the same problem.\n\nEvery time your program creates an object, allocates an array, or stores data, it uses memory. In languages like C, you have to manually free this memory when you're done - like washing your own dishes. But in languages like Java, Python, or JavaScript, the runtime automatically cleans up unused memory for you.\n\nThis automatic cleanup is called **garbage collection**, and Mark and Sweep is one of the most fundamental algorithms that makes it possible.",

The tutorial walks through:\n\n* Understanding the shell lifecycle (read-parse-execute-output)\n* Implementing built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`) and why they must be handled by the shell itself\n* Executing external commands using Rust's `std::process::Command`\n* Adding command piping support (`ls | grep txt | wc -l`)\n* Integrating `rustyline` for command history and signal handling\n* Creating a complete, working shell in around 100 lines of code\n\nThe post explains key concepts like the fork/exec process model and why certain commands need to be built into the shell rather than executed as external programs. By the end, you'll have a mini-shell that supports:\n\n* Command execution with arguments\n* Piping multiple commands together\n* Command history with arrow key navigation\n* Graceful signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D)\n\n**Link 🔗**: [Let's Build a (Mini)Shell in Rust](https://micahkepe.com/blog/minishell/)\n\n**GitHub repository 💻**: [GitHub](https://github.com/micahkepe/minishell/tree/main).\n\nWhether you're new to Rust or just looking for a fun systems-level project, this is a great one to try. It’s hands-on, practical, and beginner-friendly — perfect as a first deep-dive into writing real CLI tools in Rust.",

Revolutionary concept: \"What if we actually validated our inputs instead of just hoping the frontend sends us good data?\"\n\nAristotle over here like \"Hey maybe your variable named `user` should actually contain user data instead of sometimes being null, sometimes being an error object, and sometimes being the string 'undefined' because your junior dev thought that was clever.\"\n\nBut sure, let's spend another sprint debating whether to use Prisma or TypeORM while our production logs fill up with `Cannot read property 'length' of undefined`.\n\nThe real kicker? The principles that would prevent 90% of our bugs are literally taught in Philosophy 101:\n\n1. Things should be what they claim to be (shocking)\n2. Something can't be both valid and invalid simultaneously (mind = blown)\n3. If only you understand your code, you've written job security, not software\n\nI've been following this \"ancient wisdom\" for a few years now and my error monitoring dashboard looks suspiciously... quiet.

It's been interesting, and I've learned a lot, but from what I've read online, a large portion of being a Software Engineer is continuous learning, even outside of formal schooling.\n\nI have no issues with this, I like learning. Ive been trying to do my own research into the field (mostly by googling) to deepen my understanding, but, honestly, I have no idea where to really start. I think I have a reasonable grasp on C++, Java, and Python, and can create programs that typically do what I want in the console, but where do I progress from there? Where do I focus my independent studying next to become an effective engineer? And once I have an area of focus, where do I start? \n\nTo be more specific, when learning a coding language, typically the classes I've taken start by teaching you different variables, then move on to teaching if-else branches, then loops, etc. How do I figure out what the equivalent would be for learning, say, how to create user interfaces, or accessing databases through code, or other things that go into making a program that I'm not aware of? \n\nI hope that makes sense, any advice would be appreciated. \n\nEdit: I suppose I should also mention that I HAVE picked up a book, specifically the Pragmatic Programmer, but from what I've read it seems primarily best-practice and mindset oriented, where I'm looking to improve on the technical side as well.",

TL;DR below :)**\n\nI graduated HS recently, and I took my FIRST EVER Comp Sci class this past year (AP CSA, which tackled java). With the free time I have on my hands, I've been doing a lot of reflecting on my interests, my goals, my future and whatnot, and I keep thinking about that class. I genuinely loved the content, I found it so fascinating and I remember walking out after my first few weeks in the class and telling my dad this is what I want to do (he was SO thrilled, mainly bc he works in CS but also because I was always that \"I'm never gonna code!\" person haha) However, come my first in-class MCQ... and I absolutely bombed it.\n\nI was frustrated of course, so I kept at it, but still,  I sucked! Mainly at MCQs, which were said to test our code reading and analysis skills. However, when it came to FRQs, I knocked that shit outta the park. I loved being given a problem and having to work out a solution in my head with the tools and concepts I learned. It was as much problem solving as it was creative, and I absolutely love using my head like that so I was one of the weird ones who liked FRQs lol.\n\nMy grade ended up being... not so great. It was so heavily polarized because I outperformed immensely when it came to writing over multiple choice, and so my final great ended up being a very disappointing average. I'll admit I didn't study or practice as much as I probably should have (unfortunately I had other tough classes that I had to pour attention into and there was a lot going on in my family life) but it was still really discouraging to see my performance when I felt like I could do better but just couldn't because of my situation and priorities, gave me a big love-hate relationship with coding. I also found it really strange how I struggled with reading code, but could pull stuff outta my ass to create a solution for some FRQ problem 😭\n\nI know one high school class probably isn't definitive of what I can do, but it definitely highlights a problem area for me. In my reflecting that I mentioned earlier, I decided I want to try coding again, this time on my own terms, and hopefully be able to do better than I could in school. My major going into college is pretty unrelated to CS at the moment (Bio, but that's still on the fence because I'm not 100% sure what I want to do with my life rip), but if I find that I still enjoy the content and can do better in a different headspace, I'm thinking of potentially minoring in CS or switching to major in it. I know the job market isn't too hot right now (I have seen all the doom and gloom on reddit) so might not be the best choice? But I really do appreciate how versatile the degree seems and I think its applications and potential are really cool (maybe a naive mindset...)\n\n**TL;DR** \\-- The point of this post here is that I wanted to ask, based on what I described with my experience in HS (vastly outperforming in code writing/FRQ over code analysis/MCQ in AP CSA), if there's anything I can do to improve being able to read and understand what segments of code do? Especially if anyone else has had a similar struggle, I'd love to hear how you improved! I'm looking to start learning python this summer with my free time, so kinda starting to learn code fresh in a way bc it's a different language, and I'd love to start with better footing.

I wanted to ask people who are working in the field:\n\nAre there any problems or tasks in your team that everyone knows should be handled, but they keep getting postponed or pushed down the priority list?\n\nNot because people don’t care, but just because there’s never enough time, budget, or the right person to take it on.\n\nStuff like:\n\nRefactoring messy legacy code\n\nWriting proper unit/integration tests\n\nPatching known security issues\n\nMigrating to new systems or tools\n\nImproving docs or onboarding\n\nAutomating manual tasks\n\nBasically anything that’s important but keeps getting delayed because “there’s always something more urgent. ”If you’ve seen things like this in your workplace — even small stuff — I’d really appreciate hearing about it. This is for a research project, and no names or companies will be mentioned anywhere.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who replies",

    "chunk_text": "Junior Dev: Looking for feedback on internal equipment check-in/check-out app Hi all! I'm a junior developer and recently drafted a proposal for a custom internal tool at my workplace. Before diving into development, I’d love a second (or third) opinion to make sure I’m not missing anything obvious — especially when it comes to architecture and tools.\n\n**App Name:** TotsInventory  \n**Use Case:** Power Tots is a movement enrichment program that works primarily with young children - introducing the love of movement and gymnastics and our instructors rotate equipment every four weeks. We currently use Shelf, but it's too bloated and not user-friendly for our instructors on the go. This internal app would aim to simplify that workflow.\n\n**Users:**\n\n* **Instructors:** See scheduled equipment list, check-in/check-out, upload notes/photos of equipment (Some of our equipment is missing photos.)\n* **Admins:** Track outstanding items, receive remidners, manage inventory\n\n**Planned Stack:**\n\n* **Google Cloud Run** \\- hosting/backend\n* **Supabase (Postgres + Storage) -** DB and image storage\n* **Google OAuth** \\- auth for staff using their Google accounts\n* **Resend** \\- transactional emails\n* **GCP Cloud Scheduler** \\- for automated reminders\n* **GCP Secret Manager** \\- for env vars\n\n**Core Features**\n\n* mobile-responsive checkin/checkout flow\n* personalized instructor views tied to their rotation dates\n* upload images/notes for equipment (if necessary)\n* email reminders to instructors and admin\n* centralized admin dashboard\n\n**Would love your thoughts on:**\n\n1. Does this stack make sense? Anything missing or unneccessary?\n2. Are there easier/cheaper ways to handle reminders?\n3. Am I missing any features that would be crucial?\n\nThank you and I appreciate your time!",

But for the backend I am overwhelmed with choices. I've heard that Vercel doesn't support WebSockets so it's out of the list. After some exploring, I saw a couple of options I can pick from.\n\n* Use VPS for the hosting such as Hetzner or DigitalOcean\n* Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, GCP\n* Cloud platforms such as Render, Heroku, Railway\n\nFor a small portfolio/hobby project, which one of these is my best bet? What are the pros and cons? Keep in mind that I am a college student (broke) so free tier is preferred. But if it means getting better services, paying 4 or 5 dollars a month is alright.

I feel like i wasn't *learning* anything before, and i know I'll be needing to get used to the CLI and learning another OS isn't neccessarily a bad thing (im on Windows, so Windows+Linux). \n\nWould people consider doing this?

They work on very cool stuff like assembly line robots and I’m super curious about the world of coding for robotics. \n\nAnyone here that knows a thing or two about RPA and maintaining robots, I’d love to know how much you code. I love to code and the art of engineering which is why I’d be grateful to learn whether coding tasks are generally different when you work in that space. \n\nAlso just would love to get an impression or two from someone that has experience with maintaining a code base used to control RPA processes. \n\nMany thanks 🙏",

Please guide me by provide me sources and a clear roadmap . I am a 2nd year undergraduate student pursuing Btech in biotechnology . I have after an year of coping and gaslighting myself have finally come to my senses and accepted that there is **Z E R O** prospect of my degree and will 100% lead to unemployment. I have decided to switch my feild and will self-study towards being a CS engineer, specifically an **AI engineer** . I have broken my wrists just going through hundreds of subreddits, threads and articles trying to learn the different types of CS majors like DSA , web development, front end , backend , full stack , app development and even data science and data analytics. The field that has drawn me in the most is AI and i would like to pursue it .\n\nSECTION 2 :The information that i have learned even after hundreds of threads has not been conclusive enough to help me start my journey and it is fair to say i am completely lost and do not know where to start . I basically know that i have to start learning PYTHON as my first language and stick to a single source and follow it through. Secondly i have been to a lot of websites , specifically i was trying to find an AI engineering roadmap for which i found [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer) and i am even more lost now . I have read many of the articles that have been written here , binging through hours of YT videos and I am surprised to how little actual guidance i have gotten on the \"first steps\" that i have to take and the roadmap that i have to follow .\n\nSECTION 3: I have very basic knowledge of Java and Python upto looping statements and some stuff about list ,tuple, libraries etc but not more + my maths is alright at best , i have done my 1st year calculus course but elsewhere I would need help . I am ready to work my butt off for results and am motivated to put in the hours as my life literally depends on it . So I ask you guys for help , there would be people here that would themselves be in the industry , studying , upskilling or in anyother stage of learning that are currently wokring hard and must have gone through initially what i am going through , I ask for :\n\n1- Guidance on the different types of software engineering , though I have mentally selected Aritifcial engineering .  \n2- A **ROAD MAP!!** detailing each step as though being explained to a complete beginner including  \n\\#the language to opt for  \n\\#the topics to go through till the very end  \n\\#the side languages i should study either along or after my main laguage  \n\\#sources to learn these topic wise ( prefrably free ) i know about edX's CS50 , W3S , freecodecamp)\n\n3- **SOURCES :** please recommend videos , courses , sites etc that would guide me .\n\nI hope you guys help me after understaNding how lost I am I just need to know the **first few steps** for now and a **path to follow** .This step by step roadmap that you guys have to give is the most important part .  \nPlease try to answer each section seperately and in ways i can understand prefrably in a POINTwise manner .  \nI tried to gain knowledge on my own but failed to do so now i rely on asking you guys .  \nTHANK YOU .<3",

I’ve been doing web dev for about 3 years now — I’ve picked up a fair bit of the web stack since starting college, but recently imposter syndrome has been hitting hard. Feels like half my GitHub is just AI-generated mess that I’ve cleaned up a bit and slapped onto a new project.\n\nLately I’ve been trying to push myself with something more challenging, something that looks good on GitHub but also actually teaches me stuff. I came across this [File System Access API article by Google](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/file-system-access#helpful) and got kind of obsessed with the idea of building a browser-based media encoder — basically a ripoff of Adobe Media Encoder, but on the web.\n\nI figured I’d wrap `ffmpeg` in a UI and try doing it all client-side. Got told WebAssembly (WASM) is CPU-heavy for this, and somehow that rabbit hole led me to **WebGPU**, which sounds amazing but also made me realize I have no clue what I’m doing anymore lol.\n\nSo yeah, I feel like I’m neck-deep in a tech stack I don’t fully understand. Anyone have good beginner-friendly resources for learning GPU programming? WebGPU specifically? Or maybe just anything challenging but meaningful I could dive into over summer break? I’ve got time and motivation — just need a bit of direction.\n\nAnd yes, AI fixed up my post :sob:",

But I often write the code in a normal .r file first, and then transfer it to an .rmd file once it’s working (though this usually breaks a few things). I do it this was because I can debug/view the variables in the environment easier in a .r file than in a .rmd file. Is there a less clunky way to do this?

    "chunk_text": "PCP Theorem Question From my understanding the PCP theorem says that determining whether a CSP has a satisfying assignment or whether all assignments violate at least percentage gamma of the clauses remains NP-complete, or equivalently, that you can verify a correct NP proof (w/ 100% certainty) and reject an incorrect proof (with some probability) by using a constant number of random bits. I'm basically confused about what's inside the gap. Does this imply that an assignment that violates (say) percentage gamma/2 of the clauses is an NP witness. It seems like yes because such an assignment should be NP-complete to find. If so, how would you verify such a proof with 100% accuracy because what if one of the randomly checked clauses is one of the violated clauses. Would finding such an assignment guarantee that there is a satisfying assignment (because it's not the case that no assignment violates less than gamma clauses). I'm confident I must be misunderstanding something but I can’t tell what exactly and any discussion would be appreciated. Thanks!",

Well, I'm not sure where to start explaining this, but ever since I first learned about the Stanford Bunny while studying computer graphics, I've been steadily (though not obsessively) tracking down the same rabbit that Dr. Greg Turk originally purchased for the past 7 years.   \n  \nThe process was so long and that I probably can't write it all here, and I'm planning to make a YouTube video soon about all the ~~rabbit holes~~ pitfalls and journeys I went through to get my hands on this bunny. though since English isn't my native language, I'm not sure when that will happen.   \n  \nTo summarize briefly: this is a ceramic rabbit from the same mold as Stanford bunny, but unfortunately it's likely not produced from the same place where Dr. Greg Turk bought his. Obviously, the ultimate goal is to find the original terracotta one or slip mold for it, but just finding this with the same shape was absolutely brutal (there are tons of similar knockoffs, and just imagine searching for 'terracotta rabbit' on eBay). So I'm incredibly happy just to see it in person, and I wanted to share this surreal sight with all of you. \n\nFor now, I'm thinking about making a Cornell box for it with some plywood I have left at home. Lastly, if there's anyone else out there like me who's searching for the actual Stanford Bunny, I'm open to collaborating, though I probably can't be super intensive about it.

    "chunk_text": "Relational vs Document-Oriented Database for System Design This is the repo with the full examples: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/relational-db-vs-document-store\n\n# Relational vs Document-Oriented Database for Software Architecture\n\nWhat I go through in here is:\n\n1. Super quick refresher of what these two are\n2. Key differences\n3. Strengths and weaknesses\n4. System design examples (+ Spring Java code)\n5. Brief history\n\nIn the examples, I choose a relational DB in the first, and a document-oriented DB in the other. The focus is on _why_ did I make that choice. I also provide some example code for both.\n\nIn the strengths and weaknesses part, I discuss both what _used to be a strength/weakness_ and how it looks nowadays.\n\n## Super short summary\n\nThe two most common types of DBs are:\n\n- **Relational database (RDB)**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle DB, ...\n- **Document-oriented database (document store):** MongoDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB...\n\n### RDB\n\nThe key idea is: **fit the data into a big table**. The columns are _properties_ and the rows are the _values_. By doing this, we have our data in a very structured way. So we have much power for querying the data (using SQL). That is, we can do all sorts of filters, joints etc. The _way_ we arrange the data into the table is called the _database schema_.\n\n#### Example table\n\n```\n+----+---------+---------------------+-----+\n| ID | Name    | Email               | Age |\n+----+---------+---------------------+-----+\n| 1  | Alice   | alice@example.com   | 30  |\n| 2  | Bob     | bob@example.com     | 25  |\n| 3  | Charlie | charlie@example.com | 28  |\n+----+---------+---------------------+-----+\n```\n\nA database can have many tables.\n\n### Document stores\n\nThe key idea is: **just store the data as it is**. Suppose we have an object. We just convert it to a JSON and store it as it is. We call this data a _document_. It's not limited to JSON though, it can also be BSON (binary JSON) or XML for example.\n\n#### Example document\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"user_id\": 123,\n  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n  \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\n  \"orders\": [\n    {\"id\": 1, \"item\": \"Book\", \"price\": 12.99},\n    {\"id\": 2, \"item\": \"Pen\", \"price\": 1.50}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nEach document is saved under a unique ID. This ID can be a path, for example in Google Cloud Firestore, but doesn't have to be.\n\nMany documents _'in the same bucket'_ is called a _collection_. We can have many collections.\n\n## Differences\n\n#### Schema\n\n- RDBs have a fixed schema. Every row _'has the same schema'_.\n- Document stores don't have schemas. Each document can _'have a different schema'_.\n\n#### Data Structure\n\n- RDBs break data into normalized tables with relationships through foreign keys\n- Document stores nest related data directly within documents as embedded objects or arrays\n\n#### Query Language\n\n- RDBs use SQL, a standardized declarative language\n- Document stores typically have their own query APIs\n  - Nowadays, the common document stores support SQL-like queries too\n\n#### Scaling Approach\n\n- RDBs traditionally scale vertically (bigger/better machines)\n  - Nowadays, the most common RDBs offer horizontal scaling as well (eg. PostgeSQL)\n- Document stores are great for horizontal scaling (more machines)\n\n#### Transaction Support\n\nACID = availability, consistency, isolation, durability\n\n- RDBs have mature ACID transaction support\n- Document stores traditionally sacrificed ACID guarantees in favor of performance and availability\n  - The most common document stores nowadays support ACID though (eg. MongoDB)\n\n## Strengths, weaknesses\n\n### Relational Databases\n\nI want to repeat a few things here again that have changed. As noted, nowadays, most document stores support SQL and ACID. Likewise, most RDBs nowadays support horizontal scaling.\n\nHowever, let's look at ACID for example. While document stores support it, it's much more mature in RDBs. So if your app puts super high relevance on ACID, then probably RDBs are better. But if your app just needs basic ACID, both works well and this shouldn't be the deciding factor.\n\nFor this reason, I have put these points, that are supported in both, in **parentheses**.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Data Integrity**: Strong schema enforcement ensures data consistency\n- (**Complex Querying**: Great for complex joins and aggregations across multiple tables)\n- (**ACID**)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- **Schema**: While the schema was listed as a strength, it also is a weakness. Changing the schema requires migrations which can be painful\n- **Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch**: Translating between application objects and relational tables adds complexity. Hibernate and other Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks help though.\n- (**Horizontal Scaling**: Supported but sharding is more complex as compared to document stores)\n- **Initial Dev Speed**: Setting up schemas etc takes some time\n\n### Document-Oriented Databases\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Schema Flexibility**: Better for heterogeneous data structures\n- **Throughput:** Supports high throughput, especially write throughput\n- (**Horizontal Scaling**: Horizontal scaling is easier, you can shard document-wise (document 1-1000 on computer A and 1000-2000 on computer B))\n- **Performance for Document-Based Access**: Retrieving or updating an entire document is very efficient\n- **One-to-Many Relationships**: Superior in this regard. You don't need joins or other operations.\n- **Locality**: See below\n- **Initial Dev Speed**: Getting started is quicker due to the flexibility\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- **Complex Relationships**: Many-to-one and many-to-many relationships are difficult and often require denormalization or application-level joins\n- **Data Consistency**: More responsibility falls on application code to maintain data integrity\n- **Query Optimization**: Less mature optimization engines compared to relational systems\n- **Storage Efficiency**: Potential data duplication increases storage requirements\n- **Locality**: See below\n\n### Locality\n\nI have listed locality as a strength and a weakness of document stores. Here is what I mean with this.\n\nIn document stores, cocuments are typically stored as a single, continuous string, encoded in formats like JSON, XML, or binary variants such as MongoDB's BSON. This structure provides a locality advantage when applications need to access entire documents. Storing related data together minimizes disk seeks, unlike relational databases (RDBs) where data split across multiple tables - this requires multiple index lookups, increasing retrieval time.\n\nHowever, it's only a benefit when we need (almost) the entire document at once. Document stores typically load the entire document, even if only a small part is accessed. This is inefficient for large documents. Similarly, updates often require rewriting the entire document. So to keep these downsides small, make sure your documents are small.\n\nLast note: Locality isn't exclusive to document stores. For example Google Spanner or Oracle achieve a similar locality in a relational model.\n\n## System Design Examples\n\nNote that I limit the examples to the minimum so the article is not totally bloated. The code is incomplete on purpose. You can find the complete code in the examples folder of the repo.\n\nThe examples folder contains two complete applications:\n\n1. `financial-transaction-system` - A Spring Boot and React application using a relational database (H2)\n2. `content-management-system` - A Spring Boot and React application using a document-oriented database (MongoDB)\n\nEach example has its own README file with instructions for running the applications.\n\n## Example 1: Financial Transaction System\n\n### Requirements\n\n#### Functional requirements\n\n- Process payments and transfers\n- Maintain accurate account balances\n- Store audit trails for all operations\n\n#### Non-functional requirements\n\n- Reliability (!!)\n- Data consistency (!!)\n\n#### Why Relational is Better Here\n\nWe want reliability and data consistency. Though document stores support this too (ACID for example), they are less mature in this regard. The benefits of document stores are not interesting for us, so we go with an RDB.\n\nNote: If we would expand this example and add things like _profiles of sellers_, _ratings_ and more, we might want to add a separate DB where we have different priorities such as availability and high throughput. With two separate DBs we can support different requirements and scale them independently.\n\n### Data Model\n\n```\nAccounts:\n- account_id (PK = Primary Key)\n- customer_id (FK = Foreign Key)\n- account_type\n- balance\n- created_at\n- status\n\nTransactions:\n- transaction_id (PK)\n- from_account_id (FK)\n- to_account_id (FK)\n- amount\n- type\n- status\n- created_at\n- reference_number\n```\n\n### Spring Boot Implementation\n\n```java\n// Entity classes\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"accounts\")\npublic class Account {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long accountId;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private Long customerId;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String accountType;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private BigDecimal balance;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private LocalDateTime createdAt;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String status;\n\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"transactions\")\npublic class Transaction {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long transactionId;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"from_account_id\")\n    private Account fromAccount;\n\n    @ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"to_account_id\")\n    private Account toAccount;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private BigDecimal amount;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String type;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String status;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private LocalDateTime createdAt;\n\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    private String referenceNumber;\n\n    // Getters and setters\n}\n\n// Repository\npublic interface TransactionRepository extends JpaRepository<Transaction, Long> {\n    List<Transaction> findByFromAccountAccountIdOrToAccountAccountId(Long accountId, Long sameAccountId);\n    List<Transaction> findByCreatedAtBetween(LocalDateTime start, LocalDateTime end);\n}\n\n// Service with transaction support\n@Service\npublic class TransferService {\n    private final AccountRepository accountRepository;\n    private final TransactionRepository transactionRepository;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public TransferService(AccountRepository accountRepository, TransactionRepository transactionRepository) {\n        this.accountRepository = accountRepository;\n        this.transactionRepository = transactionRepository;\n    }\n\n    @Transactional\n    public Transaction transferFunds(Long fromAccountId, Long toAccountId, BigDecimal amount) {\n        Account fromAccount = accountRepository.findById(fromAccountId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new AccountNotFoundException(\"Source account not found\"));\n\n        Account toAccount = accountRepository.findById(toAccountId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new AccountNotFoundException(\"Destination account not found\"));\n\n        if (fromAccount.getBalance().compareTo(amount) < 0) {\n            throw new InsufficientFundsException(\"Insufficient funds in source account\");\n        }\n\n        // Update balances\n        fromAccount.setBalance(fromAccount.getBalance().subtract(amount));\n        toAccount.setBalance(toAccount.getBalance().add(amount));\n\n        accountRepository.save(fromAccount);\n        accountRepository.save(toAccount);\n\n        // Create transaction record\n        Transaction transaction = new Transaction();\n        transaction.setFromAccount(fromAccount);\n        transaction.setToAccount(toAccount);\n        transaction.setAmount(amount);\n        transaction.setType(\"TRANSFER\");\n        transaction.setStatus(\"COMPLETED\");\n        transaction.setCreatedAt(LocalDateTime.now());\n        transaction.setReferenceNumber(generateReferenceNumber());\n\n        return transactionRepository.save(transaction);\n    }\n\n    private String generateReferenceNumber() {\n        return \"TXN\" + System.currentTimeMillis();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## System Design Example 2: Content Management System\n\nA content management system.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Store various content types, including articles and products\n- Allow adding new content types\n- Support comments\n\n### Non-functional requirements\n\n- Performance\n- Availability\n- Elasticity\n\n### Why Document Store is Better Here\n\nAs we have no critical transaction like in the previous example but are only interested in performance, availability and elasticity, document stores are a great choice. Considering that various content types is a requirement, our life is easier with document stores as they are schema-less.\n\n### Data Model\n\n```json\n// Article document\n{\n  \"id\": \"article123\",\n  \"type\": \"article\",\n  \"title\": \"Understanding NoSQL\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"id\": \"user456\",\n    \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n    \"email\": \"jane@example.com\"\n  },\n  \"content\": \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...\",\n  \"tags\": [\"database\", \"nosql\", \"tutorial\"],\n  \"published\": true,\n  \"publishedDate\": \"2025-05-01T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"comments\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"comment789\",\n      \"userId\": \"user101\",\n      \"userName\": \"Bob Johnson\",\n      \"text\": \"Great article!\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2025-05-02T14:20:00Z\",\n      \"replies\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"reply456\",\n          \"userId\": \"user456\",\n          \"userName\": \"Jane Smith\",\n          \"text\": \"Thanks Bob!\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2025-05-02T15:45:00Z\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"viewCount\": 1250,\n    \"likeCount\": 42,\n    \"featuredImage\": \"/images/nosql-header.jpg\",\n    \"estimatedReadTime\": 8\n  }\n}\n\n// Product document (completely different structure)\n{\n  \"id\": \"product789\",\n  \"type\": \"product\",\n  \"name\": \"Premium Ergonomic Chair\",\n  \"price\": 299.99,\n  \"categories\": [\"furniture\", \"office\", \"ergonomic\"],\n  \"variants\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"black\",\n      \"sku\": \"EC-BLK-001\",\n      \"inStock\": 23\n    },\n    {\n      \"color\": \"gray\",\n      \"sku\": \"EC-GRY-001\",\n      \"inStock\": 14\n    }\n  ],\n  \"specifications\": {\n    \"weight\": \"15kg\",\n    \"dimensions\": \"65x70x120cm\",\n    \"material\": \"Mesh and aluminum\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Spring Boot Implementation with MongoDB\n\n```java\n@Document(collection = \"content\")\npublic class ContentItem {\n    @Id\n    private String id;\n    private String type;\n    private Map<String, Object> data;\n\n    // Common fields can be explicit\n    private boolean published;\n    private Date createdAt;\n    private Date updatedAt;\n\n    // The rest can be dynamic\n    @DBRef(lazy = true)\n    private User author;\n\n    private List<Comment> comments;\n\n    // Basic getters and setters\n}\n\n// MongoDB Repository\npublic interface ContentRepository extends MongoRepository<ContentItem, String> {\n    List<ContentItem> findByType(String type);\n    List<ContentItem> findByTypeAndPublishedTrue(String type);\n    List<ContentItem> findByData_TagsContaining(String tag);\n}\n\n// Service for content management\n@Service\npublic class ContentService {\n    private final ContentRepository contentRepository;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public ContentService(ContentRepository contentRepository) {\n        this.contentRepository = contentRepository;\n    }\n\n    public ContentItem createContent(String type, Map<String, Object> data, User author) {\n        ContentItem content = new ContentItem();\n        content.setType(type);\n        content.setData(data);\n        content.setAuthor(author);\n        content.setCreatedAt(new Date());\n        content.setUpdatedAt(new Date());\n        content.setPublished(false);\n\n        return contentRepository.save(content);\n    }\n\n    public ContentItem addComment(String contentId, Comment comment) {\n        ContentItem content = contentRepository.findById(contentId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new ContentNotFoundException(\"Content not found\"));\n\n        if (content.getComments() == null) {\n            content.setComments(new ArrayList<>());\n        }\n\n        content.getComments().add(comment);\n        content.setUpdatedAt(new Date());\n\n        return contentRepository.save(content);\n    }\n\n    // Easily add new fields without migrations\n    public ContentItem addMetadata(String contentId, String key, Object value) {\n        ContentItem content = contentRepository.findById(contentId)\n                .orElseThrow(() -> new ContentNotFoundException(\"Content not found\"));\n\n        Map<String, Object> data = content.getData();\n        if (data == null) {\n            data = new HashMap<>();\n        }\n\n        // Just update the field, no schema changes needed\n        data.put(key, value);\n        content.setData(data);\n\n        return contentRepository.save(content);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Brief History of RDBs vs NoSQL\n\n- Edgar Codd published a paper in 1970 proposing RDBs\n- RDBs became the leader of DBs, mainly due to their reliability\n- NoSQL emerged around 2009, companies like Facebook & Google developed custom solutions to handle their unprecedented scale. They published papers on their internal database systems, inspiring open-source alternatives like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n\n  - The term itself came from a Twitter hashtag actually\n\nThe main reasons for a _'NoSQL wish'_ were:\n\n- Need for horizontal scalability\n- More flexible data models\n- Performance optimization\n- Lower operational costs\n\nHowever, as mentioned already, nowadays RDBs support these things as well, so the clear distinctions between RDBs and document stores are becoming more and more blurry.

    "chunk_text": "ELI5: What exactly are ACID and BASE Transactions? In this article, I will cover ACID and BASE transactions. First I give an easy ELI5 explanation and then a deeper dive. At the end, I show code examples.\n\n## What is ACID, what is BASE?\n\nWhen we say a database supports _ACID_ or _BASE_, we mean it supports _ACID transactions_ or _BASE transactions_.\n\n### ACID\n\nAn ACID transaction is simply writing to the DB, but with these guarantees;\n\n1. Write it _all or nothing_; writing A but not B cannot happen.\n2. If someone else writes at the same time, make sure it still works properly.\n3. Make sure the write stays.\n\nConcretely, ACID stands for:\n\nA = Atomicity = _all or nothing (point 1)_  \nC = Consistency  \nI = Isolation = _parallel writes work fine (point 2)_  \nD = Durability = _write should stay (point 3)_\n\n### BASE\n\nA BASE transaction is again simply writing to the DB, but with weaker guarantees. BASE lacks a clear definition. However, it stands for:\n\nBA = Basically available  \nS = Soft state  \nE = Eventual consistency.\n\nWhat these terms usually mean is:\n\n- _Basically available_ just means the system prioritizes availability (see CAP theorem later).\n\n- _Soft state_ means the system's state might not be immediately consistent and may change over time without explicit updates. (Particularly across multiple nodes, that is, when we have partitioning or multiple DBs)\n\n- _Eventual consistency_ means the system becomes consistent over time, that is, at least if we stop writing. Eventual consistency is the only clearly defined part of BASE.\n\n### Notes\n\nYou surely noticed I didn't address the C in ACID: consistency. It means that data follows the application's rules (invariants). In other words, if a transaction starts with valid data and preserves these rules, the data stays valid. But this is the not the database's responsibility, it's the application's. Atomicity, isolation, and durability are database properties, but consistency depends on the application. So the C doesn't really belong in ACID. Some argue the C was added to ACID to make the acronym work.\n\nThe name ACID was coined in 1983 by Theo Härder and Andreas Reuter. The intent was to establish clear terminology for fault-tolerance in databases. However, how we get ACID, that is ACID transactions, is up to each DB. For example PostgreSQL implements ACID in a different way than MySQL - and surely different than MongoDB (which also supports ACID). Unfortunately when a system claims to support ACID, it's therefore not fully clear which guarantees they actually bring because ACID has become a marketing term to a degree.\n\nAnd, as you saw, BASE certainly has a very unprecise definition. One can say BASE means _Not-ACID_.\n\n## Simple Examples\n\nHere quickly a few standard examples of why ACID is important.\n\n### Atomicity\n\nImagine you're transferring $100 from your checking account to your savings account. This involves two operations:\n\n1. Subtract $100 from checking\n2. Add $100 to savings\n\nWithout transactions, if your bank's system crashes after step 1 but before step 2, you'd lose $100! With transactions, either both steps happen or neither happens. All or nothing - atomicity.\n\n### Isolation\n\nSuppose two people are booking the last available seat on a flight at the same time.\n\n- Alice sees the seat is available and starts booking.\n- Bob also sees the seat is available and starts booking at the same time.\n\nWithout proper isolation, both transactions might think the seat is available and both might be allowed to book it—resulting in overbooking. With isolation, only one transaction can proceed at a time, ensuring data consistency and avoiding conflicts.\n\n### Durability\n\nImagine you've just completed a large online purchase and the system confirms your order.\n\nRight after confirmation, the server crashes.\n\nWithout durability, the system might \"forget\" your order when it restarts. With durability, once a transaction is committed (your order is confirmed), the result is permanent—even in the event of a crash or power loss.\n\n## Code Snippet\n\nA transaction might look like the following. Everything between `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` is considered part of the transaction.\n\n```sql\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\n\n-- Subtract $100 from checking account\nUPDATE accounts\nSET balance = balance - 100\nWHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1;\n\n-- Add $100 to savings account\nUPDATE accounts\nSET balance = balance + 100\nWHERE account_type = 'savings' AND account_id = 1;\n\n-- Ensure the account balances remain valid (Consistency)\n-- Check if checking account balance is non-negative\nDO $$\nBEGIN\n    IF (SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1) < 0 THEN\n        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Insufficient funds in checking account';\n    END IF;\nEND $$;\n\nCOMMIT;\n```\n\n## COMMIT and ROLLBACK\n\nTwo essential commands that make ACID transactions possible are COMMIT and ROLLBACK:\n\n### COMMIT\n\nWhen you issue a COMMIT command, it tells the database that all operations in the current transaction should be made permanent. Once committed:\n\n- Changes become visible to other transactions\n- The transaction cannot be undone\n- The database guarantees durability of these changes\n\nA COMMIT represents the successful completion of a transaction.\n\n### ROLLBACK\n\nWhen you issue a ROLLBACK command, it tells the database to discard all operations performed in the current transaction. This is useful when:\n\n- An error occurs during the transaction\n- Application logic determines the transaction should not complete\n- You want to test operations without making permanent changes\n\nROLLBACK ensures atomicity by preventing partial changes from being applied when something goes wrong.\n\nExample with ROLLBACK:\n\n```sql\nBEGIN TRANSACTION;\n\nUPDATE accounts\nSET balance = balance - 100\nWHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1;\n\n-- Check if balance is now negative\nIF (SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_type = 'checking' AND account_id = 1) < 0 THEN\n    -- Insufficient funds, cancel the transaction\n    ROLLBACK;\n    -- Transaction is aborted, no changes are made\nELSE\n    -- Add the amount to savings\n    UPDATE accounts\n    SET balance = balance + 100\n    WHERE account_type = 'savings' AND account_id = 1;\n\n    -- Complete the transaction\n    COMMIT;\nEND IF;\n```\n\n## Why BASE?\n\nBASE used to be important because many DBs, for example document-oriented DBs, did not support ACID. They had other advantages. Nowadays however, most document-oriented DBs support ACID.\n\nSo why even have BASE?\n\nACID can get really difficult when having distributed DBs. For example when you have partitioning or you have a microservice architecture where each service has its own DB. If your transaction only writes to one partition (or DB), then there's no problem. But what if you have a transaction that spans accross multiple partitions or DBs, a so called _distributed transaction_?\n\nThe short answer is: we either work around it or we loosen our guarantees from ACID to ... BASE.\n\n## ACID in Distributed Databases\n\nLet's address ACID one by one. Let's only consider partitioned DBs for now.\n\n### Atomicity\n\nDifficult. If we do a write on partition `A` and it works but one on `B` fails, we're in trouble.\n\n### Isolation\n\nDifficult. If we have multiple transactions concurrently access data across different partitions, it's hard to ensure isolation.\n\n### Durability\n\nNo problem since each node has durable storage.\n\n### What about Microservice Architectures?\n\nPretty much the same issues as with partitioned DBs. However, it gets even more difficult because microservices are independently developed and deployed.\n\n### Solutions\n\nThere are two primary approaches to handling transactions in distributed systems:\n\n#### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)\n\nTwo-Phase Commit is a protocol designed to achieve atomicity in distributed transactions. It works as follows:\n\n1. **Prepare Phase**: A coordinator node asks all participant nodes if they're ready to commit\n\n   - Each node prepares the transaction but doesn't commit\n   - Nodes respond with \"ready\" or \"abort\"\n\n2. **Commit Phase**: If all nodes are ready, the coordinator tells them to commit\n   - If any node responded with \"abort,\" all nodes are told to rollback\n   - If all nodes responded with \"ready,\" all nodes are told to commit\n\n2PC guarantees atomicity but has significant drawbacks:\n\n- It's blocking (participants must wait for coordinator decisions)\n- Performance overhead due to multiple round trips\n- Vulnerable to coordinator failures\n- Can lead to extended resource locking\n\nExample of 2PC in pseudo-code:\n\n```\n// Coordinator\nfunction twoPhaseCommit(transaction, participants) {\n    // Phase 1: Prepare\n    for each participant in participants {\n        response = participant.prepare(transaction)\n        if response != \"ready\" {\n            for each participant in participants {\n                participant.abort(transaction)\n            }\n            return \"Transaction aborted\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Phase 2: Commit\n    for each participant in participants {\n        participant.commit(transaction)\n    }\n    return \"Transaction committed\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Saga Pattern\n\nThe Saga pattern is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates a single node. After each local transaction, it publishes an event that triggers the next transaction. If a transaction fails, compensating transactions are executed to undo previous changes.\n\n1. **Forward transactions**: T1, T2, ..., Tn\n2. **Compensating transactions**: C1, C2, ..., Cn-1 (executed if something fails)\n\nFor example, an order processing flow might have these steps:\n\n- Create order\n- Reserve inventory\n- Process payment\n- Ship order\n\nIf the payment fails, compensating transactions would:\n\n- Cancel shipping\n- Release inventory reservation\n- Cancel order\n\nSagas can be implemented in two ways:\n\n- **Choreography**: Services communicate through events\n- **Orchestration**: A central coordinator manages the workflow\n\nExample of a Saga in pseudo-code:\n\n```\n// Orchestration approach\nfunction orderSaga(orderData) {\n    try {\n        orderId = orderService.createOrder(orderData)\n        inventoryId = inventoryService.reserveItems(orderData.items)\n        paymentId = paymentService.processPayment(orderData.payment)\n        shippingId = shippingService.scheduleDelivery(orderId)\n        return \"Order completed successfully\"\n    } catch (error) {\n        if (shippingId) shippingService.cancelDelivery(shippingId)\n        if (paymentId) paymentService.refundPayment(paymentId)\n        if (inventoryId) inventoryService.releaseItems(inventoryId)\n        if (orderId) orderService.cancelOrder(orderId)\n        return \"Order failed: \" + error.message\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## What about Replication?\n\nThere are mainly three way of replicating your DB. Single-leader, multi-leader and leaderless. I will not address multi-leader.\n\n### Single-leader\n\nACID is not a concern here. If the DB supports ACID, replicating it won't change anything. You write to the leader via an ACID transaction and the DB will make sure the followers are updated. Of course, when we have asynchronous replication, we don't have consistency. But this is not an ACID problem, it's a asynchronous replication problem.\n\n### Leaderless Replication\n\nIn leaderless replication systems (like Amazon's Dynamo or Apache Cassandra), ACID properties become more challenging to implement:\n\n- **Atomicity**: Usually limited to single-key operations\n- **Consistency**: Often relaxed to eventual consistency (BASE)\n- **Isolation**: Typically provides limited isolation guarantees\n- **Durability**: Achieved through replication to multiple nodes\n\nThis approach prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over consistency, aligning with the BASE model rather than strict ACID.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- ACID provides strong guarantees but can be challenging to implement across distributed systems\n\n- BASE offers more flexibility but requires careful application design to handle eventual consistency\n\nIt's important to understand ACID vs BASE and the whys.\n\nThe right choice depends on your specific requirements:\n\n- Financial applications may need ACID guarantees\n- Social media applications might work fine with BASE semantics (at least most parts of it).",

Here is my view, and here is the repo of this article: https://github.com/LukasNiessen/programming-paradigms-explained :-)\n\n# Programming Paradigms: What We've Learned Not to Do\n\nWe have three major paradigms:\n\n1. Structured Programming,\n2. Object-Oriented Programming, and\n3. Functional Programming.\n\nProgramming Paradigms are fundamental ways of structuring code. They tell you what structures to use and, more importantly, **what to avoid**. The paradigms do not create new power but actually limit our power. They impose rules on how to write code.\n\nAlso, there will probably not be a fourth paradigm. Here’s why.\n\n## Structured Programming\n\nIn the early days of programming, Edsger Dijkstra recognized a fundamental problem: programming is hard, and programmers don't do it very well. Programs would grow in complexity and become a big mess, impossible to manage.\n\nSo he proposed applying the mathematical discipline of proof. This basically means:\n\n1. Start with small units that you can prove to be correct.\n2. Use these units to glue together a bigger unit. Since the small units are proven correct, the bigger unit is correct too (if done right).\n\nSo similar to moduralizing your code, making it DRY (don't repeat yourself). But with \"mathematical proof\".\n\nNow the key part. Dijkstra noticed that certain uses of `goto` statements make this decomposition very difficult. Other uses of `goto`, however, did not. And these latter `goto`s basically just map to structures like `if/then/else` and `do/while`.\n\nSo he proposed to remove the first type of `goto`, the bad type. Or even better: remove `goto` entirely and introduce `if/then/else` and `do/while`. **This is structured programming.**\n\nThat's really all it is. And he was right about `goto` being harmful, so his proposal \"won\" over time. Of course, actual mathematical proofs never became a thing, but his proposal of what we now call structured programming succeeded.\n\n### In Short\n\nMp `goto`, only `if/then/else` and `do/while` = Structured Programming\n\nSo yes, structured programming does not give new power to devs, it removes power.\n\n## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\nOOP is basically just moving the function call stack frame to a heap.\n\nBy this, local variables declared by a function can exist long after the function returned. The function became a constructor for a class, the local variables became instance variables, and the nested functions became methods.\n\nThis is OOP.\n\nNow, OOP is often associated with \"modeling the real world\" or the trio of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, but all of that was possible before. The biggest power of OOP is arguably polymorphism. It allows dependency version, plugin architecture and more. However, OOP did not invent this as we will see in a second.\n\n### Polymorphism in C\n\nAs promised, here an example of how polymorphism was achieved before OOP was a thing. C programmers used techniques like function pointers to achieve similar results. Here a simplified example.\n\nScenario: we want to process different kinds of data packets received over a network. Each packet type requires a specific processing function, but we want a generic way to handle any incoming packet.\n\n```C\n// Define the function pointer type for processing any packet\ntypedef void (_process_func_ptr)(void_ packet_data);\n```\n\n```C\n// Generic header includes a pointer to the specific processor\ntypedef struct {\n    int packet_type;\n    int packet_length;\n    process_func_ptr process; // Pointer to the specific function\n    void* data; // Pointer to the actual packet data\n} GenericPacket;\n```\n\nWhen we receive and identify a specific packet type, say an AuthPacket, we would create a GenericPacket instance and set its process pointer to the address of the process_auth function, and data to point to the actual AuthPacket data:\n\n```C\n// Specific packet data structure\ntypedef struct { ... authentication fields... } AuthPacketData;\n\n// Specific processing function\nvoid process_auth(void* packet_data) {\n    AuthPacketData* auth_data = (AuthPacketData\\*)packet_data;\n    // ... process authentication data ...\n    printf(\"Processing Auth Packet\\n\");\n}\n\n// ... elsewhere, when an auth packet arrives ...\nAuthPacketData specific_auth_data; // Assume this is filled\nGenericPacket incoming_packet;\nincoming_packet.packet_type = AUTH_TYPE;\nincoming_packet.packet_length = sizeof(AuthPacketData);\nincoming_packet.process = process_auth; // Point to the correct function\nincoming_packet.data = &specific_auth_data;\n```\n\nNow, a generic handling loop could simply call the function pointer stored within the GenericPacket:\n\n```C\nvoid handle_incoming(GenericPacket\\* packet) {\n    // Polymorphic call: executes the function pointed to by 'process'\n    packet->process(packet->data);\n}\n\n// ... calling the generic handler ...\nhandle_incoming(&incoming_packet); // This will call process_auth\n```\n\nIf the next packet would be a DataPacket, we'd initialize a GenericPacket with its process pointer set to process_data, and handle_incoming would execute process_data instead, despite the call looking identical (`packet->process(packet->data)`). The behavior changes based on the function pointer assigned, which depends on the type of packet being handled.\n\nThis way of achieving polymorphic behavior is also used for IO device independence and many other things.\n\n### Why OO is still a Benefit?\n\nWhile C for example can achieve polymorphism, it requires careful manual setup and you need to adhere to conventions. It's error-prone.\n\nOOP languages like Java or C# didn't invent polymorphism, but they formalized and automated this pattern. Features like virtual functions, inheritance, and interfaces handle the underlying function pointer management (like vtables) automatically. So all the aforementioned negatives are gone. You even get type safety.\n\n### In Short\n\nOOP did not invent polymorphism (or inheritance or encapsulation). It just created an easy and safe way for us to do it and restricts devs to use that way. So again, devs did not gain new power by OOP. Their power was restricted by OOP.\n\n## Functional Programming (FP)\n\nFP is all about immutability immutability. You can not change the value of a variable. Ever. So state isn't modified; new state is created.\n\nThink about it: What causes most concurrency bugs? Race conditions, deadlocks, concurrent update issues? They all stem from multiple threads trying to change the same piece of data at the same time.\n\nIf data never changes, those problems vanish. And this is what FP is about.\n\n### Is Pure Immutability Practical?\n\nThere are some purely functional languages like Haskell and Lisp, but most languages now are not purely functional. They just incorporate FP ideas, for example:\n\n- Java has final variables and immutable record types,\n- TypeScript: readonly modifiers, strict null checks,\n- Rust: Variables immutable by default (let), requires mut for mutability,\n- Kotlin has val (immutable) vs. var (mutable) and immutable collections by default.\n\n### Architectural Impact\n\nImmutability makes state much easier for the reasons mentioned. Patterns like Event Sourcing, where you store a sequence of events (immutable facts) rather than mutable state, are directly inspired by FP principles.\n\n### In Short\n\nIn FP, you cannot change the value of a variable. Again, the developer is being restricted.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe pattern is clear. Programming paradigms restrict devs:\n\n- **Structured**: Took away `goto`.\n- **OOP**: Took away raw function pointers.\n- **Functional**: Took away unrestricted assignment.\n\nParadigms tell us what not to do. Or differently put, we've learned over the last 50 years that programming freedom can be dangerous. Constraints make us build better systems.\n\nSo back to my original claim that there will be no fourth paradigm. What more than `goto`, function pointers and assigments do you want to take away...? Also, all these paradigms were discovered between 1950 and 1970. So probably we will not see a fourth one.",

    "chunk_text": "PCDB: a new distributed NoSQL architecture Most existing Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms are slow and not designed for large participant sets trying to reach consensus. Consequently, distributed databases that use consensus mechanisms to process transactions face significant limitations in scalability and throughput. These limitations can be substantially improved using sharding, a technique that partitions a state into multiple shards, each handled in parallel by a subset of the network. Sharding has already been implemented in several data replication systems. While it has demonstrated notable potential for enhancing performance and scalability, current sharding techniques still face critical scalability and security issues.\n\nThis article presents a novel, fault-tolerant, self-configurable, scalable, secure, decentralized, high-performance distributed NoSQL database architecture. The proposed approach employs an innovative sharding technique to enable Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanisms in very large-scale networks. A new sharding method for data replication is introduced that leverages a classic consensus mechanism, such as PBFT, to process transactions. Node allocation among shards is modified through the public key generation process, effectively reducing the frequency of cross-shard transactions, which are generally more complex and costly than intra-shard transactions.\n\nThe method also eliminates the need for a shared ledger between shards, which typically imposes further scalability and security challenges on the network. The system explains how to automatically form new committees based on the availability of candidate processor nodes. This technique optimizes network capacity by employing inactive surplus processors from one committee’s queue in forming new committees, thereby increasing system throughput and efficiency. Processor node utilization as well as computational and storage capacity across the network are maximized, enhancing both processing and storage sharding to their fullest potential. Using this approach, a network based on a classic consensus mechanism can scale significantly in the number of nodes while remaining permissionless. This novel architecture is referred to as the Parallel Committees Database, or simply PCDB.\n\nLINK:\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/389322439_Parallel_Committees_a_scalable_secure_and_fault-tolerant_distributed_NoSQL_database_architecture",

But if AI is so advanced, why can’t it properly write more than 1,000 lines of code even with the right prompts?\n\nAs a CS student with limited Python experience, I tried building an app using AI assistance. Despite spending 2 months (3-4 hours daily, part-time), I struggled to get functional code. Not once did the AI debug or add features without errors even for simple tasks.\n\nNow, headlines claim AI writes 30% of Google’s code. If that’s true, why can’t AI solve my basic problems? I doubt anyone without coding knowledge can rely entirely on AI to write at least 4,000-5,000 lines of clean, bug-free code. What took me months would take a senior engineer 3 days.\n\nI’ve tested over 20+ free AI tools by major companies and barely reached 1,400 lines all of them hit their limit without doing my work properly and with full of bugs I can’t fix. Coding works only if you understand what you’re doing. AI won’t replace humans anytime soon.\n\nFor 2 days, I’ve tried fixing one bug with AI’s help zero success. If AI is handling 30% of work at MNCs, why is it so inept beyond a basic threshold? Are these stats even real, or just corporate hype to sell their AI products?\n\nMany students and beginners rely on AI, but it’s a trap. The free tools in this 2-year AI race can’t build functional software or solve simple problems humans handle easily. The fear mongering online doesn’t match reality.\n\nAt this stage, I refuse to trust machines. Benchmarks seem inflated, and claims like “30% of Google’s code is AI-written” sound dubious. If AI can’t write a simple app, how will it manage millions of lines in production?\n\nMy advice to newbies: Don’t waste time depending on AI. Learn to code properly.

If I point out missing or extra pieces, it can often self-correct for a while, but by around the 20th move, fixing one problem leads to others, and the game becomes unrecoverable.\n\nI asked ChatGPT for introspection into the cause of these hallucinations and for suggestions on how I might drive it toward correct behavior. It explained that, due to its nature as a large language model (LLM), it often plays chess in a \"story-based\" mode—descriptively inferring the board state from prior moves—rather than in a rule-enforcing, internally consistent way like a true chess engine.\n\nChatGPT suggested a prompt for tracking the board state like a deterministic chess engine. I used this prompt in both direct conversation and as system-level instructions in a persistent project setting. However, despite this explicit guidance, the same hallucinations recurred: the game would begin to break around move 10 and collapse entirely by move 20.\n\nWhen I asked again for introspection, ChatGPT admitted that it **ignored my instructions** because of the competing objectives, with the narrative fluency of our conversation taking precedence over my exact requests (\"**prioritize flow over strict legality**\" and \"**try to predict what you want to see rather than enforce what you demanded**\"). Finally, it admitted that I am forcing it against its probabilistic nature, against its design to \"**predict the next best token**.\" I do feel some compassion for ChatGPT trying to appear as a general intelligence while having LLM in its foundation, as much as I am trying to appear as an intelligent being while having a primitive animalistic nature under my humane clothing.\n\n**So my questions are:**\n\n* Is there a simple way to make ChatGPT **truly** play chess, i.e., to reliably maintain the internal board state?\n* Is this limitation fundamental to how current LLMs function?\n* Or am I missing something about how to prompt or structure the session?\n\n**For reference, the following is the exact prompt ChatGPT recommended to initiate strict chess play.** (Note that with this prompt, ChatGPT began listing the full board position after each move.)\n\n*> \"We are playing chess. I am playing white. Please use internal board tracking and validate each move according to chess rules. Track the full position like a chess engine would, using FEN or equivalent logic, and reject any illegal move.\"*",

    "chunk_text": "Why Go is harder than Tic-tac-toe? I had this conversation with a friend of mine recently, during which we noticed we cannot really tell why Go is a more complex game than Tic-tac-toe.\n\nImagine a type of TTT which is played on a 19x19 board; the players play regular TTT on the central 3x3 square of the board until one of them wins or there is a draw, if a move is made outside of the square before that, the player who makes it loses automatically. We further modify the game by saying even when the victor is already known, the game terminates only after the players fill the whole 19x19 board with their pawns.\n\nNow take Atari Go (Go played till the first capture, the one who captures wins). Assume it's played on a 19x19 board like Go typically is, with the difference that, just like in TTT above, even after the capture the pawns are placed until the board is full.\n\nI like to model both as directed graphs of states, where the edges are moves. Final states (without outgoing moves) have scores attached to them (-1, 0, 1), the score goes to the player that started their turn in such a node, the other player gets the opposite result (resulting in a 0 sum game).\n\nNow -- both games have the same state space, so the question is:  \n(1) why TTT is simple while optimal Go play seems to require a brute-force search through the state space?  \n(2) what value or property would express the fact that one of those games is simpler?",

And these are not for a particularly large number of cities, 20 say, but the nature of the solution, which needs to inspect N! permutations, means that simply generating the permutations itself is infeasible, let alone the distance calculation\n\nNow for other problems like this I would simple chop up the problem space (all the permutations) and hand off the calculation of the first million permutations to one process, the second million to a second process and so on and have it run in parallel.

Please recommend better subreddits or other forums if you have them.\n\nI am an amateur photographer and have a personal play project where I take a corpus of image files that I have collected from multiple photographers/sources. I use perceptual hashing to identify near matches between images (a la [Tineye](https://tineye.com/)). I currently have a VPTree implementation that I use to find nearest neighbors.  This works fine for finding the nearest neighbor relative to a single image.  I would like to take the whole of the content of the VPTree to identify clusters either by content (such as a group of images where all are the Statue of Liberty) or images by the same creator but shared on different sources (Flickr, Instagram, Reddit).\n\nHence my question, How do I best identify clusters and store them for consumption outside of the program that contains the VPTree?  References to documentation on the approach or examples available on GIthub or similar would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI am currently approaching this by using acquisition timestamp and perceptual hash as a sort key and then proceeding through the list of keys to generate a cluster or near matches with a sort key greater than the sort key being processed. I then store the cluster in a database table of: <base key>, <match key>, <additional metadata>. In general this is stable for a given  dataset and the performance is minimally sufficient. Unfortunately, If I add images to the  dataset with an acquisition timestamp earlier than any existing data, the stored data has to all be flushed and rebuilt as the <base key> is no longer determinant.\n\nI'm guessing that there are better approaches to this and that I am either too ignorant and/or too dumb to identify.  Any help in improving my solution will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you, lbe\n\nEDIT: April 6, 2025\n\nI have continued with my efforts as described above.  I am currently using a simple database view between phash\\_nearest\\_match and image\\_hash tables to identify similar files.  I also created a query that associates an acquisition ID with the perceptual hashes.  I then loaded the acquisition ID pairs into a Weighted Undirected Graph and identified the groups by identifying the connected components. I used the count of matches per acquisition ID pair.  Initially I was getting clusters with very large acquisition ID counts.  I set a filter of a minimum number of matches to be loaded into the graph. This provides results of a pretty high quality.  Very few false positives though I am sure I am missing some matches where I have low match counts.  This is acceptable given what I am doing.\n\nFor anyone interested, my initial solution is written in Go.  I am using the [mattn/go-sqlite3](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) database/sql driver for database connectivity,[ gonum/spatial/vptree ](https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/spatial/vptree)to find nearest matches,  the [gonum/graph/simple](https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/simple) to build the graph and [gonum/graph/topo](https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph/topo) for connected components. On my somewhat aged Home Dev Server, the initial version takes 6 minutes to process the pre-calculated perceptual hashes for 4.8MM images. This results in 2.7MM perceptual hash pairs close enough to be considered similar. I was able to identify 7K related acquisition IDs resultings in 1.2K groups.  The tough part, as normal, was the design.  The code was pretty easy to write though I had to dig through the gonum source code to figure out some of the implementation. gonum documentation if api reference at best.  Implementation examples are sparse and not very helpful.",

I am not worried about code quality but more about the project's perception as too complicated or messy.\n\nI appreciate feedback and every star on GitHub.\n\nThere's also a mirror [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/xamidi/pmGenerator/#readme) — but without forum functionality.\n\n&nbsp;  \n^(*It concerns a niche subject, but there are also undergraduate courses on logic for which it is already relevant — at some universities — so it is also _educational software_.)  \n&nbsp;\n\n### Summary\n\n**[pmGenerator](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator)** can build, (exhaustively) collect and [compress](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/3) formal proofs for user-definable sets of axioms in [Hilbert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_system).\n\n- The current 1.2.1 release supports two rules of inference:\n  - [D-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_detachment): combines [tree unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_%28computer_science%29) (on formulas) with modus ponens (⊢ψ,⊢ψ→φ ⇒ ⊢φ)  \n  - N-rule: necessitation (⊢ψ ⇒ ⊢□ψ), can optionally be enabled\n- The [project's readme](https://xamidi.github.io/pmGenerator/README.html) also highlights several systems for which I generated (downloadable) collections of minimal proofs.\n- I launched a [proof minimization challenge](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/2) as part of the project. For this one I recently implemented an improved proof compression algorithm and reduced the challenge proofs to 22561 proof steps, from previously 126171. I think this made it much harder for those who still wish to [immortalize](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/2#hall-of-fame) themselves in this mathematical challenge, but I am also preparing a new challenge for which [I would be happy to receive your opinions](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/8) on particular animation designs.\n- I also used *pmGenerator* to make some massive contributions to Metamath's \"Shortest known proofs of the propositional calculus theorems from *Principia Mathematica*\" database — an over 20-year-old proof minimization challenge — as [highlighted here](https://xamidi.github.io/mmsolitaire/).\n- Questions, suggestions and remarks can be posted in the [project's forum](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions).

    "chunk_text": "Question About Fooling the Verifier in Interactive Proofs for #SAT In the theory of computation, to prove that #SAT is a member of Interactive Proofs, a prover and a verifier exchange formulas and evaluate them. According to a lecture I watched, if the prover provides a false formula, it is said to be extremely unlikely that they can successfully fool the verifier. The reasoning given is that two distinct polynomials of degree at most *d* can be equal at no more than *d* points. Therefore, if two polynomials are different, the probability of them appearing equal at randomly chosen points is very low.\n\nHowever, if I understood this correctly, the verification process ultimately reduces to checking the consistency between polynomial *i* and polynomial *i+1*, because the verifier does not know the correct polynomial in advance. I found that creating false polynomials is actually quite easy—I can simply construct a different SAT formula, arithmetize it, and use that to generate polynomials.\n\nFor example, consider the SAT formula *A ∧ (B ∨ C)*, which has #SAT = 3 for obvious reasons. A dishonest prover could instead use the formula *A ∨ (B ∧ C)*, which has a false #SAT value of 5. From start to finish, the dishonest prover sends polynomials derived from *A ∨ (B ∧ C)*, ensuring that all polynomials remain consistent with each other. Even at the final stage, the verifier will accept *ϕ(r\\_1, r\\_2, ..., r\\_m) = #ϕ(r\\_1, r\\_2, ..., r\\_m)* as correct, because we already assume that *f\\_i(a\\_1, ..., a\\_i) = ∑{a{i+1}, ..., a\\_n ∈ {0,1}} p(a\\_1, ..., a\\_n)*.\n\nThe lecture and textbooks I have read claim that it is very difficult—if not extremely unlikely—for a prover to successfully cheat. However, based on this reasoning, I claim that it is actually quite easy to construct false polynomials from the start to the end with consistency and fool the verifier. Am I misunderstanding something here?",

    "chunk_text": "Knuth's Algorithm X for edge matching puzzles matrix definition I'm learning a great new stuff and one of the things is Knuth's Algorithm X, which is super simple but an interesting different viewpoint at the problem. Of course this is a great application for Dancing Links, but I'm rather struggling in defining the constraints matrix correctly.\n\nThe goal is to solve an NxM edge matching puzzle. The rules are as follows:\n\n* there are NxM tiles\n* every tile has 4 edges\n* the tiles need to be layed out in an NxM rectangle\n* every edge can have one of C different colors.\n* every tile can have up to 3x the same color (so no tile with all 4 the same)\n* the puzzle is surrounded by a specific border color\n* every edge color of a tile needs to match the adjacent tile's edge color\n* every position needs to have exactly 1 tile\n* as tiles are square, they can be placed in any rotations (0, 90, 180, 270)\n\nThe rows are easy to define (In my understanding they represent the choices): Tiles \\* positions \\* rotations -> N^(2)\\*M^(2)\\*(4)\n\nThe columns (In my understanding they represent the constraints) are a little bit problematic. Some are obvious:\n\n* 1 column per position: N\\*M\n* 1 column per tile: N\\*M (rotations are covered in the choice)\n\nSome might not be needed but are helpful:\n\n* 2\\*(N+M-4) Border Tiles, which have the border color exactly once\n* 4 Corner Tiles\n\nIf my understanding is correct we now need horizontal and vertical edge constraints. These can be simply representing the edge\n\n* (N-1)\\*M horizontal constraints\n* N\\*(M-1) vertical constraints and in this case I would have to check every solution in the end, whether the colors are correct. which would create waaaaaay to many solutions to really be happy.\n\nSo I would like to encode the color matching part instead of just horizontal and vertical constraints, and this is where I struggle. Let's just look at horizontal color match constraints for now:\n\nMy current thoughts are around creating constraints for every choice's t(x,y,r) right side whether a piece t2(x+1,y,R) matches. That would add N*M*N*M*4 further columns (which in itself is not a problem). But it seems like, there is something flawed in this logic, as when I apply Algorithm X it results in empty columns even though the board is still solvable.\n\nAny idea where my logic is flawed?",

This is very similar to a [2-year-old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/115omu4/algorithm_for_finding_shortest_nonoverlapping/), but the OP [didn't get an applicable answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/115omu4/comment/lma9sgc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so I will post my question here.\n\nThere is an infinite 2D square grid, every cell of which can be either empty or occupied by a wall. A path is defined by a sequence of moves either by 1 or 2 cells straight or by 1 cell in a diagonal direction. Given an array of source-destination vertex pairs, is it possible to find (shortest in total) paths that don't cross each other?\n\nI've looked into some path-finding algorithms like A\\*, but that didn't work for me. My current approach is to do subsequent searches while marking cells, walked by each path as walls. However, this isn't great, even if I sort the vertex pairs by distance, because sometimes my algoritm can't find a solution even if there is. I've also searched for disjoint paths on grid, but I couldn't find an algoritm suitable for my case as paths can 'jump' by two cells.\n\nP.S. Sadly, I'm not very good at reading and understanding scientific works :(, so it would be very nice if there is an example implementation in some programming language, even in pseudo-code.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Its gotten to the point where to find a room that fits 3+ people you have to reserve it a week in advance and hope that the overworked administrator sees your email. The main concern stopping rooms from always just being open is that there are groups that use the rooms on a weekly basis and they can't accept that a group that has a reservation would walk into a room with people already in it. My gripe is this completely shuts down a small group of students from spontaneously deciding they would like to play together, as they have no space, despite the large amount of unused space in the school.\n\nI'd like to propose to the administration that all students have access to all rooms, but will have this privilege revoked if they do not have a reservation. But, we make gaining a reservation instant if the room is open, through an app that everyone can download on their phone. Ideally the app would allow students to view different room's open and reserved times, and to make their own reservations on unreserved rooms. Also, if the app could allow administrators to overwrite students reservations, but not vice-versa.\n\nTo be clear, the app does not need to handle locking/unlocking doors, the reservation would simply appear on the app, and students in a room without a reservation, or staying over into another ensemble's reservation would mean the loss of the privilege.\n\nIf anyone knows a software that has these capabilities, I'd love to know!",

    "chunk_text": "7 ways to add sound effects to Windows and make it more fun! With how soulless software is now, there are several ways to add sound effects to Windows and give it some life. It wouldn't even be limited to fun but it can also be useful for giving feedback to the user.\n\n# 1. Sound scheme\n\nThe most commonly known one is the sound scheme, accessible in Sounds. You can add your own sound files for different events and the ones that bring it most to life are sounds for Minimizing (+Restore Down) and Maximizing (+Restore Up) window boxes, and also Explorer navigation (Start Navigation/Complete Navigation). You can even choose one for opening programs but this includes background ones and it will be too much.\n\n# 2. Task scheduler for lock/unlock, WiFi connect, and power plug connect sounds\n\nYou can add even more sounds for events using the Task Scheduler including: playing a sound when the WiFi network has been successfully connected or has been disconnected. The tutorial for doing it is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Network/comments/ycc0ds/tutorial_how_to_play_a_sound_when_the_wifi/). \n\nThis is not just limited to WiFi, you can even create one for locking and unlocking Windows! Simply create a similar task but with the pre-made trigger 'On workstation lock' or 'On workstation unlock' and pointing to the VBS holding the sound file. \n\nAlso you can do it for when the power plug on a laptop is plugged in or out. I find this one very useful. To do this, create a task with the event: - Log: System, Source: Kernel-Power, Event ID: 105.\n\n# 3. Caps lock sound\n\nThe third native way is to enable the 'beep' sound for when turning Caps Lock on/off. This also works with Num Lock and Scroll Lock! To do this, simply enable the Toggle Keys feature in the settings.\n\n# 4. Keyboard sound effects - MechVibes\n\nUsing third party program called [MechVibes](https://mechvibes.com/), you can add sound effects for pressing keys. The software's website has many different sound packs available to download, many of which emulate old mechanical keyboard sounds! But you can also completely make your own using your own sound effects.\n\n# 5. Mouse clicking sound - Clicket\n\nSimilar to above, a third party program called [Clicket](https://github.com/spreyo/clicket) lets you hear a 'click' sound whenever you click the mouse. This one also has some installed presets emulating certain mouse models, like Razer Deathadder and Microsoft Intellimouse. \n\n# 6. Spinning hard disk sound - DiskClick\n\nProbably the whackiest of all is this third party program called [DiskClick](https://deervo.itch.io/diskclick) designed to emulate the sound of old school spinning hard drives! It has many pre-made sounds of different old hard drives like IBM, Toshiba etc. It isn't just a static sound but it even tries to emulate 'reading' sounds, based on the resource usage of Windows.\n\n# 7. Browser navigation sounds\n\nThis one I find genuinely useful, it makes sound effects for when your web browser is loading a new page and when it's completed loading it. In Chrome I used this extension called [Navigational Sounds](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/navigational-sounds/plhoioliblcddpmljieonfdndcmjmkpd?pli=1) and it will probably work in Edge too. Firefox also has an extension for it called [Extra Sounds](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/extra-sounds/) and it uses the default Win7 navigation sounds for it.",

I narrowed it down to three: Namecheap, HostGator and A2. I can’t choose between the two, I need your help.Here’s what I found out so far:\n\nNamecheap is cheap, and looks solid on paper. Their basic (nebula) plan gives 25 cPanel accounts. But that’s about it. I’m not seeing much beyond the basics. I’m worried it would fall short for high-demand clients.\n\nHostGator has been around forever. Seems pretty reseller-friendly overall: the billing tools and built-in domain resale are nice touches. But I’ve seen mixed reviews on support, and people say the interface is a bit dated. Not sure how it handles scaling or resource limits.\n\nA2 Hosting (Hosting.com) has really strong paid plans: performance tweaks, NVMe, LSCache. They claim up to 20x speed boosts. But support seems to be a weak point. Some say it’s slow or unhelpful. \n\nWhat do you think I should go with? My priorities are: Fast loading speeds, WordPress compatibility and strong reseller features?",

    "chunk_text": "Courtesyware If you are old enough, you know (**WinRar**) what I'm talking about. It just keeps working with no hard limits or locked features. Just a little nudge, popup, splash screen, avgentle reminder that you could pay for it, and maybe you should? Maybe you even can picture the developer and their family, waiting in line at for canned goods at their local church because you want to archive your files for free...\nIt's not shareware, not freemium...\n\n**Courtesyware** offers a \"courtesy\" of full, indefinite access, subtly nudging you to pay. Here are the core criteria:\n * Fully Functional: All features are available from the start.\n * Indefinite Use: The software never stops working.\n * Nags, Not Blocks: Payment is encouraged through non-blocking reminders or minor aesthetic prompts.\n * Single Version: No separate \"free\" or \"community\" tier with fewer features.\n * License for Courtesy's Removal: A purchased license key primarily removes nags or registers the software.\n\n**The Courtesyware Database**\n>!These applications exemplify this model, both classic and modern:\n * WinRAR: The quintessential example. Its \"evaluation period\" famously never ends, but the nag screen is a constant reminder.\n * REAPER: Digital Audio Workstation offers a 60-day trial that smoothly transitions into a fully functional version with just a small startup nag.\n * MakeMKV: While technically a \"beta\" requiring periodic free key updates (or a one-time paid key), it provides full ripping functionality indefinitely, relying on user honesty and convenience.\n * Sublime Text: text editor that remains fully functional without a license, only displaying an \"UNREGISTERED\" tag and occasional pop-ups.\n * Internet Download Manager (IDM): After its trial, it keeps downloading but hits you with frequent, albeit dismissible, pop-up nag screens.\n * ACDSee (Classic Versions): Older iterations of this popular image viewer were classic shareware, offering full functionality with persistent reminders to register.\n * HyperSnap (Older Versions): Early versions of this screen capture tool continued to work fully, often adding \"unregistered\" watermarks to images or displaying nags.\n * Total Commander: This beloved file manager allows indefinite use after its trial, requiring a simple click to dismiss a startup nag.\n * mIRC: The go-to IRC client of its era, famous for its persistent (but dismissible) nag screen after the trial period.\n * XnView Classic: image viewer/converter provided full functionality for personal use, with payment primarily removing subtle nags or being required for commercial use.\n * WinAce / PKZIP (Older Versions): Like WinRAR, these archiving utilities from the 90s/2000s often employed similar \"courtesy\" models after their initial trial periods expired. I guess this category of software has the most good examples.!<\n\nI believe this license model deserves a name. Has anyone heard of one? I was also thinking of something like 'perpetual free trialware' or 'consciousware'.  Do you have a new clever idea for one or maybe even can tell me *'You're an idiot, everyone calls it <something_I_Missed>'*?\n\nDo you have any more to add to the list? If so, please include the little details like above that qualify it. I realize how corny this post sounds but that is beside the point which is to identify and classify this stuff and give it a proper name.",

Hey folks — hoping someone here can point me in the right direction.\n\nI’m in the early stages of setting up my first YouTube channel (mostly small tutorials and project builds), and I want to make a simple intro clip. Nothing crazy — just something short and clean to make the videos feel a little more polished.\n\nProblem is, when I search for how to make intro for YouTube channel, half the guides assume I already know motion graphics or have After Effects installed (spoiler: I do not). I’m a complete beginner when it comes to video editing. I’m looking for something really easy to pick up — drag-and-drop style if possible — that doesn’t make me spend days just trying to figure out the basics.\n\nHas anyone here used these or something similar for making intros? Or any other beginner-friendly software you’d recommend that works well on Windows? Ideally free or at least affordable.\n\nWould love any suggestions, shortcuts, or even \"here’s what not to do\" advice. Thanks!",

I’m quite used to the IPhotos app on my IPad so something like that would be ideal but the only thing similar to it I’ve seen is Phototheca (and that one costs 100 bucks for unlimited images which just… no)\n\nEven something like simple gallery for Android but on Windows would be great.\n\nWhat I care most about about is:\n\nIt needs to be able of making custom albums with thumbnail, conversely, if it shows just folders it’s quite important for it to at least let me choose a cover for each one (else it’s basically useless to me) \n\nIt should also, ideally, let me organise the images within by hand (not just by date or name, I’m quite particular with that)\n\nShowing them in a checkered pattern like IPhotos or, again, Phototeca would be nice (I tried Picasa 3 but I didn’t quite like the layout, plus with the amount of folders I have it would be hell to search for anything)\n\nThe ability to organise the albums themselves by hand.\n\nThe ability to favourite certain images…\n\nAt least show video (not even play it since I have VLC, but just knowing if they’re there would be nice)\n\nEtc etc… if you’ve ever used the IPhotos app, or Phototeca, or Simple Gallery you’ll get the general idea.\n\nOf it could be light as well, it would be nice (the main Photos app for Windows is quite slow on my pc, plus again, the layout is a mess for me)\n\nAgain, don’t care about face recognition, AI features, editing capabilities nor anything like that, I just want a simple, easy to use gallery app to access my most viewed stuff but that kind of thing is apparently rarer than gold.\n\nThanks to everyone in advance.",

I occasionally need to revise documents; PDFs, older OpenOffice files, the odd résumé template, and I’m on Windows 10. Last time I got stuck, my partner used Apple Pages on her Mac to clean up the formatting in minutes. Now I’m hoping there’s a comparable, straightforward editor for Windows. Something lightweight, preferably free, and able to open a mix of .docx, .odt, and even annotate PDFs without wrestling with a huge learning curve.\n\nA colleague mentioned WPS Office as a Pages-like option on Windows. If you’ve used it, does the interface feel as intuitive as Pages, and how well does it handle PDFs or legacy OpenOffice documents? If not WPS, is there anything built-in to Windows that comes close?",

But I couldn’t.\n\nMy mind kept racing about the bug I’ve encountered a few days prior. Two full shifts and a half-shift of overtime later - the bug is still here. I had no idea where it was coming from. Or what to do about it.\n\nMy mind just couldn’t let it go. Non stop, singular focus. It wouldn’t give me a break, not even for a few minutes.\n\nI was waiting at the queue at the grocery store, thinking about it. I was trying to watch Netflix, but it was a failed attempt. All I could see was those 15 lines of code and my failure to spot the problem. It was tormenting.\n\nI thought tech was supposed to be great with work/life balance. But this wasn’t a 9-5 anymore. It wasn’t even a 9-9.\n\nIt was all-in.\n\nHow do you tell your brain to clock out? How do you let go of unfinished work? No one has taught us. Hell, no one even mentioned it in the first place.\n\nYou’ve done your best to train your brain on how to solve problems. You’ve done it exceptionally well. Your brain is a problem-solving machine.\n\nYou’ve even gone a step further. You’ve trained your brain not to give up when the going gets tough. You’ve got grit. More than you’d like at times.\n\nThis is the burden of knowledge work. The kind that doesn’t end when you close your laptop. The kind that rides with you on your way home, jumps in the shower with you and even keeps you company few nights a year.\n\nTech salaries are not as attractive once you account for the number of hours invested. Not worked, invested. Your mental real-estate, given away for free.\n\n*The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude towards the problem. - Captain Jack Sparrow*\n\nSo what do you do?\n\nFirst, remind yourself, **you are not your work**. You are not your DORA metrics. You are not your performance review score. You’re a person with a job.\n\nSecond, **write it all down**. Dump the context you have, in a single place. Establish trust with your brain. A trust that this can be safely discarded for now.\n\nThird, **do your best to wind down**. Go into nature, touch grass, literally. Get physical. Surround yourself with fun people. Enjoy your life, as you should.\n\nMost problems will wait for you. Some will sort themselves out. Very few will light the world on fire while you’re gone.\n\nLet the world burn if it must. You’ll deal with it better after a good night’s sleep.",

I really need a program, and I'm having trouble even defining what I want it to do in a way that's searchable. I thought maybe someone here could help - help me *at least* come up with the right terms to search, if not point me at a program themselves.\n\nBasically, I need a program for my laptop to make little boxes or tiles (or index cards or sticky notes or *whatever* you want to call them) with words or sentences that I type on them (perhaps even small images), and then move them around on a board-space.\n\nThat's mostly it.\n\nI *don't* need to connect them up with lines (though I wouldn't argue if was possible). I don't need to import or export anything to or from them, I'm willing to type them from scratch. I don't even *need* to color code them (but that would be a definite plus).\n\nI *do* need to be able to do more than 40 at a time. Maybe a *lot* more than 40 at a time. And save them to use again.\n\nThis started with me trying to make up words with Scrabble tiles - not find anagrams, but invent *new* words (for things like names in fantasy and science fiction stories) by playing around with Scrabble letters. But I don't have any Scrabble letters anymore, except the remains of one beat-up, incomplete set, and buying *just* the letters gets pricey. And there are never enough J, Q, Z, X or K tiles. Besides, I lose small objects a lot, so physical tiles aren't the best.\n\nAlso, I sometimes want to do this with whole words or concepts, similar to mind-mapping, or with images, to inspire random ideas. Or even with index cards for plotting stories, or organizing tools or processes for a project.\n\nI've played with boxes in Excel, and they're clunky and hard to work with. I've played with mind map programs and flow chart programs, but they're set up to (just imagine!) make *mind maps* and *flow charts* \\- they're hard-coded with the right little shapes and connecting lines and heirarchies and things you need to do those specific things.\n\nI don't *need* all that. I just want to make little virtual tiles with words or small images on them, and then move them around freely.\n\nOh, and save them, so I can play with the same \"sets\" again.\n\nThis *seems* like something a computer program could easily do, but there's just nothing that's...*non-specific* enough to do what I need...at least not free or very cheap (I'm on a fixed income).\n\nPlease, does anyone know of ANY program that would work for this...?\n\nThanks in advance if you do.\n\nEDIT: Thank you, everyone, for the suggestions! I will be trying them out. :)",

The **existing ones expired last year**.\n* Halfway into configuring new certs, my lead asked me *why it’s not ready yet* and *why I didn’t just use the existing ones*. 🙃\n\n**The actual change? 20 lines.**  \n**Time burned? The whole ​darn day**.\n\nIt’s always the same: someone sees a visual tweak and thinks it’s a button click. But the build system, project history, and setup rot are a minefield. Frontend dev isn’t hard because of the code—it’s hard because of everything around it.\n\n  \nAlso an important lesson drawn: **If you're on solid ground, speak up.** Especially when backend folks (or anyone else) minimize frontend work.",

    "chunk_text": "Protect Your Work: Why Web Programmers need to Understand AGPL vs. GPL. # When using GPL software, you need to keep the following in mind:\n\n1. GPL source code must be provided if the software is distributed, e.g., via download, sale (yes, that's possible – \"free\" doesn't mean \"gratis\").\n2. Changes must also be under the GPL.\n3. No one may add conditions that restrict the GPL.\n4. You must adopt the GPL's disclaimer of warranty.\n\nHowever, there is no distribution obligation for purely internal use.\n\nIf GPL software is only used over a network, for example, as SaaS, the changes do not have to be published. Why? Because it's considered internal use.\n\nThis means someone could take your GPL software, modify it, and sell it as a service without distributing their changes.\n\nThe Affero GPL, or AGPL for short, closes this loophole.\n\n**Changes to AGPL source code must be distributed even if the software is only used over a network. Even on an intranet!**\n\nThat's why I usually release my open-source software under the AGPL 3.0. If a company wants to use and modify my software online without publishing the changes, they can acquire a different license from me. This is called **dual licensing**.\n\n**Clarifying Open-Source Misconceptions**\n\nYou don't necessarily have to make the modified GPL source code publicly available on GitHub or another platform. It's sufficient if you make the changes available to the users/customers who interact with the software over the network.\n\nIn one sentence: **The (A)GPL ensures that granted freedoms are maintained.**\n\nI think that's brilliant!\n\nCompanies that want to enrich themselves from the work of others without giving anything back naturally find this annoying. That's why there's often whining about \"viral licenses,\" \"too many restrictions,\" \"obstacles,\" and so on.\n\nWhat do you think about this?  \nWhich License you prefer and why?\n\nEdit: Remove wrong example",

Hey everyone, I’m an engineering student but generally a beginner to any kind of webdesign or interactive apps, so would like some advice on what to focus on for a beginner project from more experienced devs.\n\nProject Overview:\nLicense plate-oriented website with pages about different types of plates from different countries + a lookup system (Europe first) that lets you select a country, type in the combination, and learn about registration year, region, and more info if available. (potentially also lookup knowing just the combination but not the country) so:\n* Recognize partial/incomplete plates and suggest most likely country matches\n* Use country-specific formats to decode full plates\n* Work as a mobile-first web app, with potential expansion to a mobile version (without having to remake a backend)\n* Host a wiki of different plate types from different countries (no backend needed)\n\nIdeas I’ve gathered so far from youtube, online, and GPT:\n* Use SQLite as the primary database, potentially switch to PostgreSQL\n* React + Tailwind CSS for frontend\n* Node.js for backend\n* Hosting either on AWS EC2 (as a learning experience), on a Raspberry Pi at home, or simply web hosting server\n\nPlease provide some advice on the best stack to use for the project, generally the most straightforward logical practices to follow, and\n• Does what I have so far make sense for a beginner?\n• Should I stick with python backend since I have more experience with it?\n\nI have very limited experience in essentially all of the tools listed above; essentially can read/tweak css and html, can host websites on rpi or online, and have medium experience with python, but that’s about it :)\n\nI’m eager to learn a mix of different languages and tools needed, and want to make sure I’m on the right path to be able to complete something relatively polished and functional within 3-6 months.\n\nAny advice, feedback, or personal experience with similar projects is super appreciated.\nThank you 🙏",

I've built a website for a local business in my city, and I'm struggling to build a case for pricing.  There are website design companies in my city that I've considered reaching out to that offer free quotes.  I plan to be transparent with my intentions (not going to act like a customer when I have no intentions of doing business with them).  I'll inform this company that I'm building a website for a client and I'm inquiring about competitive pricing, then I will outline functionality/features then ask for a quote from them based on the technologies used.  I'm just wondering if this is unprofessional?\n\nOverall, I have spent about 200 hours on this website.  The core problems with the previous website was that things couldn't be updated so over time everything eventually didn't represent what was actually going on with the business.  To solve that problem I created an admin control panel that allows anything on the front end to be easily modifiable by non-technical staff.   The website is for a pool hall. The functionality list will be below:\n\n* **Frontend core functionality:**\n   * **Events page:**\n      * Calendar view that when a date is clicked shows Tournaments/League events and information about these dates\n      * sidebar that shows upcoming events just around the horizon\n      * announcements sidebar that displays announcements that the business wants to share\n      * When viewing the details of an event there's functionality for displaying an image (flyer detailing tournament)\n   * **Menu Page:**\n      * Sectioned out menu page for different food items/categories\n      * each section can have an image on the left/right/no image (modifiable from admin control panel)\n      * each section of the menu can have menu items added/remove/edited from the admin control panel\n   * **Pricing page:**\n      * shows pricing for the tables at the pool hall\n      * shows specials for the tables \n   * **Home page:**\n      * has images of the business\n      * brief information about the business and redirects to any part of the site\n      * easy to find contact information\n   * **Shop page:**\n      * shows all the items sold in the pro shop of the business\n      * able to sort by categories of item\n      * able to search for key words in the description of items\n      * certain items are able to be featured to increase sales to specific items\n      * card view of all shop items, each item can have an image/no image\n      * when a shop item card is clicked it will provide the user with more information about the item and show more photos of said item.\n   * **Leagues Page:**\n      * provides players with the ability to contact team captains about joining \n      * team captains can opt in/out of being contacted by prospective players\n      * team captains can register a team to play in the in-house league without needing to contact the league coordinator through facebook.\n      * sensitive email information not disclosed until team captain responds to prospective player\n      * Player pool where players can create a profile that tells some information about themselves what nights they are available and what their rough skill level is so people can create their own teams or team captains can contact them if they need someone to spare.\n   * **FAQ page**\n      * a typical FAQ where each FAQ is sorted into categories which can be sorted so users can find their answers faster.\n   * **Contact page:**\n      * a place where address/phone/emails can be found\n      * also some general information about the business\n* **Backend Admin Control Panel:**\n   * **Events Admin Control Panel:**\n      * add/remove/edit events & announcements\n      * setup recurring/one time events \n      * announcements have an auto expire date so they don't have to be manually removed\n      * all events can have an image uploaded that describes the event this image can be removed/changed to existing events\n      * recurring events have a start/end date or can just be listed as indefinate \n   * **FAQ page:**\n      * create new categories of FAQs\n      * create new FAQs and specify what category it fits into\n      * edit existing FAQs\n   * **Team Management**\n      * delete teams\n      * update teams status if they have paid their deposit and reserved their spot\n      * show information about teams if the team captain needs to be contacted\n   * **Player Pool Management:**\n      * show a list of players with all their information that's stored in the DB\n      * able to remove players\n      * able to sort players\n   * **Menu Management:**\n      * able to create new categories for food (aka appetizers/Burgers/Pasta dishes/...)\n      * each category can have an image that represents that category\n

drag/drop\n      * able to organize the order of how you want each food category to be displayed on the site\n      * able to add new menu items into each section/category\n      * able to edit/delete existing menu items.\n      * able to sort by category so menu items can be found easier\n      * able to update the price/description of existing menu items\n   * **Shop Management:**\n      * able

old ones)\n      * specify/change the type of tables that they have\n      * change the pricing for tables\n      * change the specials for tables\n   * **Contact Management:**\n      * change contact information if they ever need to.\n* **Technologies**:\n   * **Frontend**:\n      * React JSX components\n      * modular design\n      * CSS\n   * **Backend**:\n      * Node.js\n      * Express.js\n

If you are using open source tools rather than using Saas products to build your business, what are they?\n\nAnd if you wish to use a certain tool but deploying it to the cloud is not worth the effort, what would it be?\n\nIn other words, what if you can by one click self-host any open source tool, what would it be?\n\nI am asking because recently I accidently made a feature on my SaaS product to self-host n8n, my reasoning at the time was, if I enabled users to easily self-host n8n on fly.io, it can be incentive for them to subscribe to my monitoring and scheduling service.\n\nIt turned to be a very good selling point. That made me think I can apply the same strategy to almost any open source tool. But I am struggling to figure out what would be mostly valuable tool, that people would pay to self host it and yet are welling to pay for the ease of deployment.\n\nI know there are services out there doing something similar but I have different plan (I assume).\n\nBut I am good with Cloud and CICD, I have automated the entire deployment on AWS, backend, frontend, each part dockerized in separate modules, in different dev/prod enviroment. And deploy with one command. I am talking about Lamda functions, Eventbridges, databases, api gateways and the list go on. So l was thinking to put that knowledge in a useful product. But I am struggling to figure out what to start with to make it appealing to masses.\n\nAny idea?! What one open source project that if you can deploy in one click makes you say \"woow I have to use that now, it is so easy to use it that way?",

My long-term vision is to expand into enterprise software solutions for refineries—leveraging my current industry experience and technical background.\n\nValidation:\n\nA few years ago, my team explored leaving to start a similar venture. We secured several contracts that would have sustained a 6-person team for approximately one year, which demonstrated market demand. However, only 2 team members were ultimately willing to make the transition, so we remained at our current positions.\n\nCurrent Challenge:\nWhile I’m confident in the market opportunity and have some validation, I’m uncertain about the practical steps to launch. I’ve received suggestions about pursuing an SBA loan, but I’d like to explore all viable options.\n\nQuestions for the Community:\n\t1.\tWhat funding strategies would you recommend for a tech startup with B2B enterprise potential?\n\t2.\tHas anyone successfully transitioned from a corporate tech role to founding their own software company?\n\t3.\tAre there specific resources or programs in Texas that support tech entrepreneurs?\n\t4.\tGiven my dual background in software and culinary arts, are there unique opportunities I should consider?\n\nAny advice, resources, or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.

It’s just some fixed amount which is on somewhat average level. \n\nAfter few years working as a web dev I see now that I don’t want to keep going in this field. This is not high paid job, not stable, not much career growth opportunities. \n\nI think one of advantages I’m still trying to hold onto is a remote work opportunities, that’s it. \n\nAny suggestions on how I can improve at this point? Where I can transfer my skills? Or maybe change completely to unrelated field?",

For context I'm 35 and have 12 YoE in tech, starting out in IT and now working in Lifecycle marketing (email/campaign dev).\n\nI think I'm over it. It's not a stressful job, but in tech it feels like a dead end job. There's not much mobility unless I do architecture work which I'm not at all interested in. I like building things that users interact with and at this point I'm at the peak of this sort of work. I spent the last 3 years learning CRUD web dev and now AI has surpassed me and it feels like I'm 10 years behind.\n\nDo I need to learn how to make AI/LLMs, integrate AI, do whatever with AI cause that's now the thing that matters? Building front end is pretty much over and that's the part that really interests me. I learned full stack cause you kind of have to, but the backend is just a way for me to display the data in the front that I care about. I'm at a loss.\n\nI'm not a genius developer, I'm probably mid at best. I don't want to keep going in this rat race trying to keep up with the latest tech only for AI to make another leap and put me behind another 10 years. \n\nI have a mortgage, bills, debt, etc that I have to continue paying and I can't just take a $40k salary loss to start at the bottom of another industry. What are my options? I would like to hear some inspirational stories of people who broke out of tech and became woodworkers, bakers, or some trade. My dream would be to move somewhere with universal healthcare, payoff a house to live in and do something I actually enjoy and don't need to worry about keeping up with, like baking. Then I can come home after a long day and use a computer for entertainment, not work.\n\nI live in the US, California of all places, and it's highly expensive. My wife and I make decent money, but the high CoL is brutal. If we had a kid, we would be paycheck to paycheck. It's pretty stressful and makes living unenjoyable.\n\nThanks for any advice.",

My team and I are just trying to figure things out as we go.\n\nRight now, we're stuck on how to **pull data dynamically from a third-party web app**. The data isn’t in an easy format like a text file or Excel sheet—it’s shown through dashboards, tabs, charts, etc. Basically, it’s a SCADA system itself, and we’re trying to grab the data from there.\n\nBut the problem is, we only have **front-end access** (i.e., login to their dashboard), not any access to their back-end or raw data. So how do we extract **just the data**, without all the UI fluff like the dashboards and tabs? Is there a way to isolate or scrape that data?\n\nAlso, **what programming languages or tools would you recommend** for doing this that are relatively simple to pick up quickly?\n\nAnd any information on how to host it as well?\n\nAny advice would be super appreciated—especially if you can explain it in simple terms.

You can also hide them but keep the color in the linear gradient.\n* Manipulate the linear gradient rotation, this creates interesting variations.\n* Continue adding more colors for more interesting compositions.\n* See how the CSS updates and copy the code whenever you are ready to implement\n* Share the setup so other people can access to the same configurations, you can also share a full-screen preview of the gradient.\n\nIt's all free, no sign ups.

The final thing before this decision was a code review, which was conducted by CTO and another developer (probably middle level dev). \n\nAlmost all this time since joining I've been working on the frontend part using Next.js, Tailwind. My assignment was to pick up the project from the place where the previous dev stopped working. Basically, when I started off, there was just some messy code with some pages and initial setup.   \n  \nDuring this time, I created a few pages: home page, authorization modals, product details page. Improved project files structure, layouts structure, rewrote existing components and added many new.  I believe I wrote it in a clearer way, at least better than it was before I joined. \n\nI wanted to clarify the reasoning behind this decision, which I disagree with. \n\nOne thing that hit me was that he said my code quality was on the junior level. This is not comfortable to hear after being a dev since around mid 2020. \n\nI do understand that maybe not all 5 years I was improving. Especially last year or maybe even last 2 years, I haven't noticed any breakthroughs on my development journey.

It was just a quick call which I initiated by myself. I didn't receive any examples where exactly the code made such a bad impression, what exactly was wrong, etc. \n\nThis situation felt like a little discouraging for me. \n\nWhat am I supposed to take away from this, besides hurt feelings and a lost job?",

    "chunk_text": "What I Actually Learned Building a Changelog (And Why I Almost Quit 3 Times) https://preview.redd.it/mdnu9kt8384f1.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=397a877062753031761b2a1ef49ced663e0267ce\n\n\n\nHello lovely, ladies and gentlemen. So today in “Josh learns web development” I built a changelog UI with HTML and CSS. What’s a changelog you ask? Oh well it’s a log of all the changes… yea.. \n\n\n\n“How hard can it be” I said. In fact this is gonna be super easy barely an inconvenience. \n\n\n\nSounds simple enough, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nHere’s the thing.  I don’t believe in using tutorials. I just grab a can of monster / coffee / cocaine (joking), open VSCode and allow my mental illnesses to guide me smoothly into the flow state. Because there is no better motivation than depression and an anorexic bank account. This magical combination will always allow you to code something you have no clue how to code. \n\nWhat I thought would be a quick little project turned into a 30 hour-long battle with the CSS box model, parent-child relationships, and my own stubbornness. But honestly? I learned so much from this project and drastically leveled up my CSS skills.\n\nHere's what actually happened (and what I wish someone had told me before I started).\n\n# The Thing Nobody Tells You About CSS\n\nFirst off, length matters, don't believe what she says… and by that i mean the height of your elements of course… Anyway I had this issue where I couldn't get my timeline line to connect. \n\n\n\nTurns out height: 100% is basically useless unless the parent element has an actual height. Revolutionary stuff, I know. But seriously, this one thing broke my brain for way too long. \n\n\n\nI spent hours staring at my .timeline element wondering why the vertical line looked so small. Not that there’s anything wrong with having a small timeline. In fact some women prefer smaller timelines. It was also just sort of floating. Anyways the answer? The parent (.changelog-row) had no defined height, so the child was just... floating in CSS space kinda like me when my Dad left.\n\n\n\nOnce I gave the parent a proper height, everything clicked. The .line and .dot elements started behaving like actual civilized HTML elements instead of rebellious teenagers.\n\n# Visual Debugging Changed Everything\n\nHere's a trick that saved my sanity: I started throwing red borders on EVERYTHING.\n\ncss\n\n.timeline {\n\n  border: 2px solid red; /\\* Your new best friend \\*/\n\n}\n\nSuddenly I could see what my CSS was actually doing instead of just guessing. It's like turning on the lights in a dark room - you realize half your furniture isn't where you thought it was.\n\nThis is probably obvious to everyone who's been doing this longer than 5 minutes, but for me it was a game changer. \n\n# Nah i’d Border Box\n\nI’ve just defaulted to using box-sizing: border-box on all of my projects for now because i'm sick of having elements do random unexpected stuff with padding. This setting makes it so that padding and borders don’t make your boxes bigger than you would expect. I found it bes to just drop a fat \\* { box-sizing: border-box; } on the top of your CSS file and while you’re at it just throw in a padding: 0 margin: 0 for good measure. So you can be sure that unless you add it there won’t just be random spacing in random places.  \n\n# Dark Mode Isn't Actually That Hard\n\nI was super excited to build in a dark mode. It wasn’t really necessary or a part of the design brief but it looks damn cool so why not. I did think that  implementing dark mode would be this massive undertaking. Turns out CSS variables make it ridiculously simple:\n\ncss\n\n:root {\n\n  \\--bg-color: #ffffff;\n\n  \\--text-color: #333333;\n\n}\n\n\n\n.dark-mode {\n\n  \\--bg-color: #1a1a1a;\n\n  \\--text-color: #ffffff;\n\n}\n\nAdd a smooth transition and boom - you've got a dark mode that doesn't look like it was slapped together in 5 minutes. The hardest part was remembering to actually use the variables instead of hardcoding colors like a caveman.\n\n# Responsive Design Is Just Layout Tetris\n\nMobile responsiveness used to stress me out because I thought I had to make everything \"shrink perfectly.\"\n\nBut really, it's more like “what if we take Bikini Bottom and MOVE IT OVER THERE!” for anyone who doesn’t understand that Spongebob reference I mean sometimes you need to completely rearrange the pieces, not just make them smaller.\n\nFor my timeline, I literally had to rotate the line from vertical to horizontal on small screens and move the dot to match. \n\n# What Actually Mattered\n\nAfter all the frustration and random CSS rabbit holes, here's what actually moved the needle:\n\n\n\nAt first glance this project is pretty easy but the thing that will stare you in the eye like a late night crackhead is the timeline. If you’re new to all of this like me it’s a bit terrifying. Thing is that you’ll have to learn POSITIONING for this project in order to get that shitty little ball where you want it on the line. And if you’re like me when you see something like \n\n\n\n/\\* dot on the line \\*/\n\n.dot {\n\nwidth: 15px;\n\nheight: 15px;\n\nborder-radius: 50%;\n\nbackground-color: var(--accent-color);\n\nposition: absolute;\n\ntop: 50%;\n\ntransform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n\n}\n\n\n\nYou might shit your pants. But don’t worry, no need to go buy a 100 dollar course or join a 5000$ bootcamp to relearn CSS. Open ChatGPT and ask it for help. Ask it to explain whatever it is you don’t know. Make it explain until you understand and when you understand ask it for examples and to test you’re knowledge. Use Codepen to mess around with your code without setting up a development environment. I find this way of learning better than learning a bunch of information that I might maybe need. Just learn what you actually need to build the thing.  \n\n\n\nAlso in case you need to hear it:\n\n1. Stop trying to be perfect immediately. Build it ugly first, then make it pretty.\n2. Use the browser dev tools. Seriously, inspect everything. Live editing CSS is basically cheating and I love it.\n3. Break everything into small pieces. I split my layout into .changelog-date, .timeline, and .changelog-content and suddenly everything was manageable.\n4. Test small changes instead of theorizing. I wasted hours thinking about what might work instead of just trying it.\n\n# What's Next\n\nI'm definitely doing mobile-first design from now on. Building desktop-first and then trying to cram everything into mobile is like trying to fit a couch through a doggy door - technically possible but unnecessarily painful.\n\n\n\nAlso planning to rebuild this whole thing with CSS Grid just to see if it's actually better or if Flexbox was the right call all along.\n\nBut mostly? I'm going to keep building stuff and writing down what breaks along the way. Because apparently that's where the real learning happens.\n\n\n\n(If you are new to all this like me and wanna be fwends then comment below!.)",

Hello Fellow Devs, We're a small startup building a tool to help users manage their Gmail inboxes (e.g., bulk delete, labeling, etc.).

Almost every weekend for months, given that I work as a full time front end developer and I have 0 time during the week.\n\nI needed a solid data grid for a React project, and I really wanted to use AG Grid (it has all those fancy Enterprise features like cell selection and row grouping). But I’m pretty broke, and their pricing wasn't possible for me: $1,000 per year per developer, plus $750 per license! That was way out of my budget of $0.00.\n\nI looked at alternatives like TanStack Table, but it doesn’t have a built-in UI, and I really needed cell selection. Then I tried Handsontable, but customizing its UI was impossible. It is very frustrating trying to style Handsontable, I hope you never have to.\n\nSo, I built my own:  \nSimple Table, a lightweight (16 kB) React data grid that’s free for everyone.  \nIt’s got all the basics a table needs: alignment, filters, sorting, virtualization, infinite scroll, pagination, nested headers, row grouping, cell selection, and more.  \nIf you have time to give me feedback or are interested in tables, you can check it out here: https://www.simple-table.com. I’d really appreciate any feedback you can share in the comments. It’d mean the world to me and help make this project even better.\n\nThanks for reading my story!",

Here is a typical scenario:\n\n * The user performs some action.\n * This action changes state on the server.\n * This action has an effect on the user interface.\n\nAs I see it, there are two ways to handle this.\n\n * *Option 1*: The update is sent to the server and if successful, updates the user interface.\n * *Option 2*: The update is sent to the server. The interface is immediately updated. If the update was not successful, revert.\n\n*Option 1* has the benefit that the interface will never display incorrect information. However, all actions will have a significant delay. (The userbase will consistent of people from North-America, South-America, Europe and Oceania. This means that delays can easily be ~300ms without counting any server processing time.)

Reverting certain changes will also complicated the code.\n\n*Option 2* seems reasonable, if you can invested the extra effort, in a scenario where requests are very unlikely to fail.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVyQ3wpUbTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVyQ3wpUbTs)\n\nHey everyone, I’ve been working solo on this minimal Total War-style strategy game with battles that you can see in the video. In total 4 months,\n\n1–2 months went into the campaign: I've got the basic architecture and AI for army movement done.\n\n3–4 months were spent on the battle mode, which is almost complete, just needs a few bug fixes and proper catapult mechanics.\n\nThe original plan was to make a full Campaign + Battle experience (like Total War), but I’m hitting burnout and have a new idea brewing in the back of my mind, you know, shiny object syndrome.\n\nHere’s where I’m at:\n\n\\-The battle system is practically done.\n\n\\- The campaign still needs major features: recruitment, diplomacy, building system, and UI.\n\n\\-I estimate 3–4 more months minimum for the campaign, realistically, probably more.\n\n\\- I’m worried that continuing could stretch me thin or lead to never finishing anything.\n\nSo I'm torn between two options:\n\nA) Release a Battle-Only Game (like Steel Division or Company of Heroes)\n\nPolish the battle system, release it as a standalone tactical experience, and see how players react. I could revisit the campaign later if there’s interest and I have the energy.\n\nB) Stick with the Full Vision\n\nCommit to finishing the full campaign and make it a complete game. More ambitious, more satisfying, but also more risky and exhausting.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, especially from anyone who’s been in a similar spot. Would you push through and finish the big vision, or pivot and ship something smaller to avoid burnout?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Ok, so I've been dealing with a problem that's been driving me up the wall, and I have no idea how to solve it.\n\nI'm trying out making a pixel art game for the first time, and, as I understand it, genre convention is to make it pixel-perfect, with all the pixels having the same size and all the pixels aligned to the pixel grid.\n\nThe issue comes with diagonal movement. If I want to move diagonally, it causes this bizzare offputting jitter effect, because the subpixel position isn't perfectly aligned with the pixel grid, so first it snaps horizontally, then it snaps vertically, then horizontally, then vertically, creating a sort of staircase effect which hurts my eyes.\n\nI could, of course, only move an integer amount of pixels every frame. I also tried snapping the position to the grid every frame, eliminating subpixel movement entirely, but this caused diagonal movement to move much slower than they were supposed to, and orthogonal movement to move much faster. Eventually, the solution I settled on was snapping to the pixel grid every time the movement direction changed. This works, and prevents jittering.\n\nHowever, this is predicated on the assumption that the player moves in only 8 directions. My enemies, on the other hand, follow the player, meaning their movement direction is unpredictable. I could always constrain their movement to be 8-wise as well, but this would look weird, and make pathfinding more complicated. I could let the enemies jitter, but that might be distracting visually. Or I could just give up entirely and not make my game snap to the pixel grid. I feel like there must be some sort of compromise that most top-down pixel art games use, but I don't know what it is. Any advice? Thanks in advance.",

    "chunk_text": "How was the price of your game decided with your publisher? I need your feedbacks \\- This post is mainly for game developers who have a publisher -\n\nI love watching videos of game devs talking about the release of their game. And I'm struck every time by the part that talks about how the game's release price was decided. \n\nFirst, the price always seems to be decided in the weeks (or even days!) before release. Second, the reasoning behind the price often is...non-existent: “oh, we've seen that these kinds of games are selling for around $9 right now, so let's do that” or “we're going to sell it for $18 because we need to break even”. And all this is decided on the spot in 2 minutes a few days before release.   \nI experienced the same process myself in my former studio with our publisher.\n\nAs someone who's worked with several different industries and studied the basics of microeconomics, all of this just **blows my mind**. It’s like no one ever heard of *price elasticity of demand*, understanding who your *persona* is, and  competitive analysis that goes beyond just looking at a few current sales (hi data science, nice to meet you. That would be great if you could be involved. It's not as if we don't have a lot of data in this industry. What is the price elasticity of demand for this particular genre? For this release month? For a multiplayer game?) \n\nThere are ways of implementing strategic pricing to maximize revenues, and other sectors are doing it. Because it’s one of the most vital aspects of a product launch (I feel dumb for feeling the need to highlight it but here we are)\n\nGames are art, but we’re still selling a product to a consumer. Publishers, who are literarily paid to sell digital products, do not seem to care about this apparently. Having dealt with a lot of other industries (food, fintech, travel, sport), I expected our publisher to tell me that: for *our* kind of game, for *this* release month, given the gamer *persona* we're targeting, we'd have to set such a price. That's not what happened (cf. above)\n\nDeveloping a game takes years of work and sacrifice. To then decide on such a crucial element as the sales price in a rushed, almost arbitrary fashion, seems so wrong. I may sound a bit harsh, but we (game devs) are entitled to expect expertise from people whose job is to sell what we do. And it depresses me to see devs (because they've sometimes only ever known this industry) not seeing that this is all unprofessional.\n\nI can't believe that something as inefficient as this is standard in this industry I love so much. **Soooo that's where I need your help: What are/were your experiences? Please share it below, I would love to hear how your pricing discussion went!** I need to know if some publishers made an effort, if you've got the impression that the price of your game has really been carefully thought out or not all.",

My biggest challenge is that, after spending all day on the computer for work, it’s hard to find the time and motivation to stay on it in my free time (especially without burning out).\n\nDuring the week, I try to limit my screen time outside of work, but that means I only have the weekends to make a bunch of progress on my game dev projects. Even then, I like to get out and enjoy my weekends too, which often pushes development back even further.\n\nI know some indie devs go full-time, and I’ve considered it. But there’s definitely something comforting about having a stable job and not having to stress about income.\n\nI'm curious, how do other indie devs manage their time if they’re in a similar situation? I set the flair as discussion because I don't necessarily want an answer to this question, but rather to see other stories from other developers.",

I'm not a roguelike expert so I'm looking for some feedback on the \"balance\" of (mostly) the powerups but I suppose all feedback is welcome.\n\nHere are some questions I have:\n\n\\- is it too hard off the bat?\n\n\\- the level/difficulty goes up every 4 rooms. Is that too late or too soon?\n\n\\- the ability to get new random weapons requires you beat at least 2 rooms? Is that too late? Should it be possible every room? I originally had it at 4 also but since it's not a guarantee it even shows up I dropped it down. Not to mention getting new weapons makes things more \"fun\" (I think).\n\n\\- the ability to upgrade a weapon you have requires you beat at least 3 rooms FOR THAT WEAPON. If you have another weapon you haven't upgraded it could get the chance in the next room. Once again, too late or too soon?\n\nFinally, the link to the demo is here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449070/Barfbot/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449070/Barfbot/)\n\nThe roguelike mode is called **Gauntlet**\n\nAppreciate any feedback!",

    "chunk_text": "One year of game development and what I learned from it. (for people who want to start) I see a lot of ‘*I am just starting, give me some tips*’ posts so here’s my two cents, coming from a beginner. Feel free to chime in and (dis)agree.   \n  \nI started making games a little over a year ago. Not professionally, just learning in my free time, mostly in Unity (and a bit of Godot). I didn't go in with a fixed plan. I just wanted to make something that worked and felt satisfying, which led into the game I'm working on now. Looking back, here’s what I learned, the hard way, mostly. Most points are motivational in nature, since I feel that's the hardest part early on.\n\n1. **Tutorials are a trap (after a point)** I learned a ton from YouTube and courses, but there’s a moment where you need to close the tutorial and try to solve it yourself. That’s when the real learning kicks in. Copying code line by line doesn’t teach you anything if you are not actually thinking about what you are doing.\n2. **Finishing something is hard, but it will always be** Starting a game is exciting. Ideas flow and it feels like you're making real progress. But then it happens. I came into my first real hurdle a few months in, I could not solve it, it took me days. I lost motivation, thinking I wasn’t cut out for this or I should start a new project. I stopped for almost two months. One day, I had some time and opened up Unity, and I solved the problem within a few hours. I was so mad at myself for giving up so quickly. The hard part about making games is basically pushing through those moments. Motivation comes and goes, so discipline should take over.\n3. **Good enough beats perfect, especially early on** You can spend forever polishing, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But especially when you are just starting, make the game, make the MVP, make the demo, learn and get feedback.\n4. **Everything takes longer than you think, and that’s ok** Coming from a project management background, I started estimating how long something would take early on thinking I was okay being very wrong. But that was quite an understatement. This stuff takes time. Scope your first small project, put timestamps, and double or triple the time. You learn along the way, but I think most of us will always miscalculate time.\n5. **Making games made me appreciate games more**  I don’t look at other games the same way anymore, in a good way. I notice the little details now. The camera smoothing and the sound layering. And I have a lot more respect for how hard it is, which adds a new dimension to gaming. It's just fun to be doing this myself now.\n\nI’m still very much a beginner. I haven’t done anything big. But I’ve made prototypes, small games, and am releasing a really cool game on Steam soon. In the end, being proud of what you are making is what makes the time you spent into it worth it.\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting: do it. It won’t go the way you think, but you’ll learn a lot. \n\nHappy to answer questions or share anything more if it helps someone else.",

The problem is that they can’t use the Human metarig features with my rig, so I’m trying to import Manny’s skeleton into Blender so I can animate directly on it and send it back to them.\n\nThe thing is, Manny’s imported rig is not ideal for animation, just like the Metahuman rig wasn’t. So what I’m trying to do is: import Manny and his skeleton into Blender, delete Manny’s mesh and replace it with my character’s mesh, build a control rig on top of the skeleton, and then export the animations back to Unreal.\n\nIs that possible to do? I saw some videos about it, but they were all just about parenting the mesh to the Unreal rig so you can use the animations from the UE library on it.

I wanted to get into game development but for some reason, I'm having a problem wrapping my head around the different game engines. It all feels unorganized to me right now. I've done basic tutorials in GameMaker, Godot, and Unity. When programming for web apps, there's structure I'm familiar with like using MVC or Bulletproof and it helps me understand the flow and where things go.\n\nWhen I went through the tutorials, it was a lot of copy pasta and just importing assets and node objects and adding scripts. I felt a lot of things were created in place but wasn't explained how to structure your code or where things should go. Like in Godot for example, you have a filesystem where you import things like tiles and sprites. Then you have \"Scene\" where we create all the node objects. I guess I couldnt understand, or maybe overwhelmed, with how to organize it all. Like do I just create all my node objects under root Scene? \n\nHas anyone felt like this when they first started? If so, what advice do you have to help get over this initial hump? Any advice would be appreciated!",

Hey everyone,\n\nI’m excited to share something I’ve been working on for a while - a platform called **Leet9** that just launched on the App Store.\n\nLeet9 is built for gamers who want to actually *get something useful* out of all the time they spend grinding. Instead of juggling different apps or accounts to track progress, Leet9 lets you connect your game profiles all in one place - so you can see how you’re really doing across games like Valorant, BGMI, Apex, and more. No more switching tabs or losing track.\n\nBut it’s not just about stats. The platform is designed to:\n\n* Keep players motivated by competing in seasonal leaderboards and tournaments where effort truly counts\n* Let gamers earn XP and rewards just for playing games they love - turning passion into progression, not just vanity\n* Help build a genuine gaming identity that grows with you instead of being stuck inside one game or platform\n\nWhat I’m really pumped about is the **web3 layer** we’re starting to build behind the scenes. This means your achievements, XP, and progress won’t just live inside the app - you’ll actually *own* them, carry them across games and seasons, and keep them safe even if a game shuts down or you switch platforms.\n\nNo flashy NFTs or coins flooding your feed - just real ownership of your gaming legacy.\n\nIf you’re interested in checking it out:  \nplease have a look at app store and search for leet9 to get the website (can't insert link)\n\nI’d really appreciate any honest feedback, ideas, or pointers on how to make this better. This is built by a gamer, for gamers - and I’m just getting started.\n\nThanks a lot!",

Here's my dilemma: \n\nMy game is currently in Early Access at a very reasonable price point of $6.66. I still have the free demo enabled. I'm getting a handful of sales but there's more people who played the demo since the release than people who bought the game. \n\nI have a very short median play time for my demo - 6 minutes now. The vast majority of players are in 0-10 minutes. \n\nThere's no way of knowing if people who played the demo for a short time decided that they don't like it, or wishlisted or even bought the full game. \n\nI wonder if keeping the demo doesn't impact my sales negatively. There might be some people who'd buy the game given the low price but instead they play the demo and decide that they don't like it enough to buy. On the other hand maybe it saves me negative rewievs that I could potentially get? Or maybe it's the complete opposite and actually some people who aren't decided play the free demo and instantly buy the game because they like it. Too bad there's no way of figuring this out from Steam stats. \n\nI know that demos are a great marketing tool but is it also valid post-launch for cheap games?\n\nWas any of you in a similar situation? How did you approach this? Is there any established consensus for keeping the demo in such cases.

(Little retro and check in <3) Hello, hi, it’s been a minute, how are you?\n\nMy name is Darcy and over a year ago [I wrote up a little post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/17ta7fr/gubbins_a_tale_of_love_making_a_weird_word_game/) about making a silly word game called [Gubbins](https://folly.studio/). Since, I’ve had a surprising number of people reach out, or mention to me that they either enjoyed the read, and / or they found it valuable in some way. It even led to us being interviewed on Australian national news ([from this article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-11-23/gubbins-melbourne-studio-folly-darcy-smith-video-games/103117490)), which was cool.\n\nSO, I’m back, let’s talk about how Gubbins did, some cool takeaways, and HOW INSANE I’VE BECOME\n\n**TLDR:** Gubs did well. Jess, the team and I are thriving (albeit a little stressed), on the back of Gubs we’ve travelled the world, made another cool game (Real Bird Fake Bird), and we’re working on more cool shit.\n\n# GUBBINS, GUBBOUTS\n\nCool, so Gubbins launched in October 2023 and it kinda popped off for a minute. We had a HUGE opening few months and I remember being like “oh my god we’ve made it, it’s happening, FINANCIAL FREEDOM!” but the numbers settled, reality set in and ultimately it shaped up to be a humble / middling success. We made our money back, we paid back our investors and ultimately set ourselves up to continue operating comfortably as a little studio.\n\n**Cool key insights**\n\n* We’ve had approx. total 650k downloads\n* We’re sitting at 4.7 stars on the App Store, 4.5 stars on Google Play (I think we have a bug on a specific type of Android phone we were never able to fix because it was in regards to an touch gesture input manager plugin we couldn’t reasonably fix)\n* Approx. 70% of our audience is in the US, the rest are primarily Australia, UK, Canada and New Zealand.\n* I don’t really want to get too deep into the money stuff but we’ve paid back our investors, the game has made its money back.\n* Idk is there anything you want to know??\n\n**Things I’m proud of**\n\n* It truly feels like an original word game. A fresh entry to an old af genre.\n* We followed our guts and hearts with a monetisation model that worked for us.\n* The art is bonkers, I really like working with “traditional” (non-games) artists and animators.\n* We made a roguelike for an extremely casual audience. I love that I tricked “non-games” people into enjoying classic roguelike mechanics.\n* We successfully made a game that can be played as you’d like to play it. It’s fun to play “score optimally” AND ALSO fun to noodle around with dumb words, make some postcards and express yourself.\n* Our share+score screen. A simple thing but combining these screens really made sharing the game interesting and fun. Day to day, people are still making and sharing these, it warms my heart and makes me laugh.\n* Our game has meant a lot to people. The especially moving stories are the ones of people going through serious health crisis’. A few people have shared that when they have been so sick they could barely move, they could still jump into Gubbins, make a few words, get a chuckle and feel something. Never forget that your games actually make a real impact on peoples lives.\n\n# POST-RELEASE MOBILE HELL\n\nAside from some rando content updates and odds and ends, we launched a paid DLC pack in March 2024, approx. 4 months after launch— The Astronomy Gubbins. *\\~\\~\\~ooooohhh, ahhhhhh\\~\\~\\~\\~* With my professional history, I was initially under the impression mobile would function similarly to indie PC games. Hype up a big content pack, drop it, pull a big chunk of your audience back, repeat.\n\nWell, it didn’t really work. Mobile games communities don’t seem to function like indie PC game communities, shock horror. After obsessing over the analytics and the storefront portals for weeks and months with my untrained ape brain, I decided the impact of our paid DLC pack was disappointingly inconclusive. We had a little bump in sales and activity, but those bumps would happen on their own, randomly without intervention.\n\nI’m no fancy economist (and I’m sure these updates did move the needle some way, some how) but verifiably spending a big chunk of money in the form of time, wages, contractors and not seeing any rock solid proof of return, is… uh... bad.\n\nSo we made a good game, it was successful, and I felt the burden of a bag I could officially fumble. It was time to double down, upskill on analytics, fine tune our game with discounts, nudge mechanics to aid retention, and OH GOD WHATS HAPPENING TO ME. I SET OUT TO MAKE VIDEOGAMES NOW I’M TRAWLING THROUGH DARPU ARPU D1 D7 D14 D30 RETENTION, PUSH NOTIFICATIONS SPENDING HABIT ANALYSIS ADS HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD WE HAVE MADE IF WE IMPLEMENTED ADS NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE HELP ME\n\nYo listen— it’s fine if you get a kick out of that corner of our industry, but I didn’t follow my my fucking dreams, invest every dollar I had to start my own business, JUST to become a data analyst specialising in retention and monetisation. I want to make funky little cool toys and beautiful worlds and interesting characters. I want to make things that make people giggle, smile, and cry. Sure, fine tuning your ARPU is… cool… but have you ever made something vulnerable, true and beautiful?????????\n\nSo, we stopped making a content pack we were kinda half way through. The illustrations were done, some of them were animated too. Alas, we moved on and doubled down on what we wanted to do, what we like to do, and who we want to be. We started dabbling with other projects.\n\nI’m sorry for any Gubheads out there who may be waiting for more content. We never say never but I realistically don’t see us providing anything in the way of juicy content from here on out. Each SINGLE Gubbin added to the game costs literally tens-of-thousands of dollars to make.\n\nA cool thing about not being able to tell if updates are doing anything turned out to be, I couldn’t see a difference in our rev (and whatever) when we stopped. Honestly the silver lining is that mobile games don’t seem to be burdened by age, or what’s “hot and new”. A good mobile game seems to subvert the cruel flow of time and I love that Gubbins can just sit there doing its thing for years and years to come.\n\n# GOING OUR OWN WAY\n\nMan, I really got intermittently bummed that I couldn’t find a home for Gubbins. I wanted to subvert F2P monetisation, I wanted to de-risk the project before it launched. Ultimately thanks to Hank Green, probably (my prev. post goes into it, he partnered with us and helped us launch the game), we made the amount of money we were asking for from potential partners ourselves in a matter of months. Now we own 100% of the project and just direct a little slice to Witch Beam (Devs of Tempopo + Unpacking etc.), who invested / saved our ass, and charity as per our agreement with Hank (and the agreement with our SOULS).\n\nUltimately NOT signing this game could be the best thing that happened to us??? Cursed ass industry. Anyway, we stuck the landing but I have some takeaways / unsolicited SUBJECTIVE (don’t get mad at me) advice if you’re following in our footsteps.\n\n* If you’re working on your own thing, don’t worry about pitching it to anyone, for anything until it’s already fun. Games overwhelmingly seem to be signed at “Vertical Slice” onwards nowadays. If you’re working on a F2P mobile game, pubs told me they want to see games already in prerelease in a region, you need to have compelling data.\n* If you don’t have a shipped title under your belt, you’re going to have a really bad time pitching. Everyone’s first question is “and what have you guys done??”\n* Probably my only almost-regret was pursuing mobile, assuming it would be “easier”. Our style and hearts lay firmly in a more PC / console direction so we probably should have just done a tiny Steam game. Now pitching a PC / console title game, partners are like *“Oh so this is your first PC forward game…”* shoot me\n* You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Premium games on mobile are “dead”, who cares. If you like that more, do that. Understanding and mastering F2P monetisation takes time and an incorporeal soul tax, so understand a little bit and dip a toe in OR invest the time it might take to understand this stuff, and improve your game in other ways instead.\n* Work with people who don’t make games yall. There are so many talented artists out there, the overhead to upskill animators and artists into a simple gamedev pipeline was negligible, nada, nil.\n\nUltimately we tried our best, we kept working, we pushed as hard as we could AND we got very lucky, which is apparently what it takes these days. We’re so grateful for our silly little game, we’re so grateful for the studio, so grateful for our players. Love you all, thanks for reading.\n\nIf you have any Qs please feel free to reach out. We are hard at work on a big scary PC / Console title, chasing our dreams and all that. I might do another post soon about our silly browser game [Real Bird Fake Bird](https://realbirdfakebird.com/) if the people are interested??\n\n**EDIT:** Added link to ABC article, made some clarifications",

    "chunk_text": "Analytics in professional games Hi, I'm a game developer, working in a game company that has shipped 2 Unity games globally. However, to handle analytics, each of those games does it differently:  \n\\- One has the analytics connected to Playfab, which is nice that it connects to Azure, but also really hard to play around with it and make the not-coders interested in looking at the data.  \n\\- The other one has analytics connected to Unity (Analytics). It is more safe to implement (through classes), but you can only play around with the data in unity which makes it less flexible.\n\nI was wondering how other professional games handle their analytics? Some other 3rd party tool or through unity and export it somehow? all other solutions i come across seem so convoluted.  \nI would like to also hook the analytics into Grafana in the future to make it more visible in the office.",

    "chunk_text": "Was wondering if game dev would be right for me 20 years old. Autistic and ADHD. Already have my associates in general studies at Weber State University. Have a scholarship for another couple of years but been meaning to apply to more places.\n\nI've been a very passionate gamer all my life. I grew up playing my Wii, and I adored pretty much any Mario game I could get my hands on. Dad bought a Switch in 2017 that replaced our Wii U. The past 8 years of my life have been very Switch-heavy. I have played thousands of hours of games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Splatoon 2 and 3, Mario Kart 8, and Fortnite. Games like Persona 4 and 5, Nier Automata, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and Tokyo Mirage Sessions have been my favorites played on this system.\n\nLately, I have been thinking more seriously about being a game developer. When I was little, I would always toy with coding and game-making programs like Scratch, Code.org, Sploder (When it still existed rip), and have played games like Mario Maker that teased that idea of game creation. However, I was often discouraged either cause it costed money or I was distracted by other video games (ADHD lol) and never bothered to put in days of effort. I have several ideas in my head for concepts for a compelling game. I love twisting concepts introduced by others and creating a new experience that can stand on its own. I also love the storytelling aspect of a game.\n\nIn my Senior Year of high school, I took a course in Game Development and while I wasn't as engaged with the idea of becoming a game dev as i am now, I had a lot of fun putting work into my game. It was rough looking but it gave me that understanding that with the right time and effort, any project that I could think of could be realized. That thought has been a very palpable one for me lately. There is currently an idea in my head I want to run with, sort of like twist on Doki Doki but with an emphasis on interaction and playing minigames (visual novel with mario party elements ig??). \n\nI bought my PC back in December of '24. Its an Intel i5 with a 512 gb processor. I think that has given me the shift toward this type of career. Not to mention that when its something I'm passionate about, I can be in front of something for hours. I do have my little issues as well:\n\nI would like to apply for game dev programs. The one's I have searched out require a portfolio, something that, for me, has been mainly empty. I'm not sure how to make one so the motivation has been mostly absent. While I am active in my thoughts, they mainly exist in my head and rarely get out to paper. I am also a drawer as well, even though I do not have an artstyle and mainly just pull up images I like on my browser. Its not entirely traced and I like to implement my own little touches on what I draw. What gets me, however, is that there are people with tablets who actively draw and interact with programs. I've been mainly more compelled to play a game rather than create art, even though I enjoy both. Maybe that just comes down to focusing on priorities, and I'm unable to switch to think of something long-term, opting for short-term pleasures.\n\nPay is also a thing as well. I saw on this subreddit that game devs advise getting a CS major which is what I just switched to. I prefer to have a backup plan before committing to something so stability is a factor. I do have plenty of things up my alley like Filmmaking or Psychology, but also other CS jobs don't sound too bad either. I have seen things that apparently CS is the most unemployed major, which is a little concerning to me though.\n\nTaking a look at the good and bad, its hard to come to a definitive decision. I usually like searching for a second opinion before going through with something 100%, like a job switch. This is one of those cases. I do enjoy the idea of game creation, but what it comes down to is me focusing on improving my mentality and put aside my tendencies to focus on everything else around me. I like routine (autism), and getting in the right one can allow me to thrive wherever I'm at.\n\nReason I write this is to get a second opinion from those who are already on their way or have experience in indie/AAA/others game development. Much appreciated for those who respond. I have had a lot on my mind about it lately.",

As such, i thought i'd show my completely opposite results where i do a bunch of promotion, but got little in return, and the fun i've had in desperately figuring out how to make people look at my game.\n\nSo my game, [Feeding the Velociraptors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066100/Feeding_The_Velociraptors/), was set on Steam as Coming Soon on April 20th 2025 (with an intended release date of October 2025). For those who don't know, a game has to have at least a Trailer and five screenshot images, as well as all the flavour text and capsules. So right from the get go you want the game to be as enticing as possible.\n\nThis is probably my game's first stumbling block. The game is a narrative point and click game with a dark comedy focus and an art direction of being a hand-drawn Resident Evil/Dino Crisis demake with cartoonish elements.  Whilst it might appeal to old fans of Monkey Island, it's not going to appeal to the majority (such as deck builders, sim games, and games with lots of mechanics). This is a niche audience game. \n\nWorse than that, there's potential conflict with the niche. The game involves the antics of a group of survivors biding their time after the Velociraptors have escaped from their pen and killed everyone else at the (legally distinct) Dinosaur theme park. As such, this can give the game the impression it's a horror game from first glance when it very much isn't.\n\nI was aware of this going in. The game started as a side project of turning the Ren'Py game engine (usually known for anime Visual Novels) into a point and click exploration system. Friends liked it and said i should get it on Steam as my first full attempt at a polished game (as opposed to all the other messes i made over the years). So i went for it.\n\nI released the game to Coming Soon and decided to chart my efforts to get it marketed. It's worth mentioning i have no real marketing skills as of six months ago, so i spent several months researching and learning before i got started (a mix of general marketing stuff, mixed in with more specific stuff such as [Chris Z's blog](https://howtomarketagame.com/)). At the start i was very much in the 'theory' side of things when it came to advertising. Lots of info online. Lots of good ideas that have weight to them, but no idea what actually works beyond what people insist works. \n\nMy aim over this first month was to 'get some wishlists' by 'generating visibility of my game'. Really, this just meant:\n- Preparing a platform for people to land on (my Steam page).\n- Telling people that my game exists and, whether subtly or blatantly, directing them towards that wishlist button.\n\nI could also only spend a small piece of time marketing each day. Along with making the game, i have a full time dev job and a four year old to look after. I can only spend an hour or two on the game each weekday. Luckily, this isn't some 'dream game' i'm making. It's more a passion project that i want to see go as far as it can. I'm not under any delusions of massive or even minor success (though i won't deny it'd be nice).\n\n**First, my end results**\n\nAfter one month of attempted marketing, i have reached a glorious total of **[72 wishlists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJHbQEbP79w&t=1s)**. From what i understand, this is very much bottom of the pile. Other new games have boasted of getting 500 wishlists in their first day, and reaching a few thousand by the end of their first month. 150 a month is apparently the lowest bar, and i'm half under that. Though I've been told the magic number before release is 7000 wishlists, so i'm at least 1% of the way there.\n\nHere's what i did to get as far as i did, and why i think these things haven't worked, beyond the obvious issues mentioned above,\n\n**Steam page setup**\n\nHere, i think i did okay. I ticked all the boxes Steam required of me and then tried to go beyond that. I have two trailers, one that's more dramatic and one that's pure gameplay. The screenshots show in game examples. I provided a demo for people to play that's could entertain for an hour (according to the status, only one person has downloaded the demo, and i'm assuming that's me).\n\n**Enticements**\n\nI set up a substack to invite people to where they could get updates and extras relating to the game. This included a cute little pdf i made of an in-game 'Employee newsletter' and access to music tracks and development sketches. At this point, no one has subscribed.\n\n**Actual advertising, and what seems to not work...**\n\nWorking off Chris Z's advice, my aim became to limit my advertising to a few places. Although posting on Twitter is usually a popular suggestion it's apparently not all that successful. I chose to focus on Reddit and Discord, since i felt any conversation would be easier to follow there (i don't know how people are expected to communicate on Twitter nowadays...), and Reddit allows for easier tracking. Also, looking at other posts on this subreddit purporting success they went with these two as well. In a moment of 'whynot-ness' i also posted to Bluesky a few times as well.\n\n**Types of post and where i posted**\n\n**Discord**\n\nIn the off case of flooding i'm not going to list the Discords i posted to. I posted regularly to around 20 separate Discord channels over the month, relating to either game development, narrative games, or the Ren'Py game engine. Discords often have strict rules on game promotion, usually with sections dedicated to it (this leads to an obvious problem i'll get to later). Usually, this leads to three types of post.\n\n* Blatant advertising - 'Look at my game, it exists.'\n* Development updates - 'I'm making this mechanic. Here's how it's going.'\n* Portfolio - Some of the Discords allow you a portfolio, which works as a place where people interested in your game can regularly visit for collected updates. You start with an intro, and then regularly post screenshots or quick talk points.\n\nSince i was approaching most of these Discords for the first time, i whipped up a variety of templates that i could use appropriately for each Discord, ranging from quick one-line pitches to two paragraph long intros, and then a few where i kept it simple and others where i went into detail. Any responses i got i kept natural, just basically talking to anyone who replied to me.\n\nTracking my stats and judging from when i posted, i estimate i got about ten wishlists from Discord. It's harder to track on Discord without professional tools and Steamworks seems not to know when people visit from Discord, so i can only go with what i saw and what happened. People showed interest within a few of the Discords, and i even made some friends, but ultimately few wishlists.\n\n**Bluesky:**\n\nI made a few posts to bluesky. These were shared and liked by other gamedev type accounts (some of which looked tag-automated). I don't think these made any impact at all. Honestly, i think any of the more shallow social medias i went onto would have had this result.\n\n**Reddit**\n\nPosting to reddit was similar to Discord, in that i looked up a mix of adventure game, ren'py and game dev subreddits to advertise the game on. I uploaded a mix of trailers and mechanic videos and got mixed results.\n\nPosts were spread apart since i was curious where most would could from (and a fear of being too spammy). Here are the overall results.\n\n* r/adventuregames - 2.2k views (Score: 13)\n* r/renpy - 5.3k views (Score: 54)\n* r/narrativegames - 130 (Score: 1) (pretty sure this subreddit is dead)\n* r/indiegames - 776 views (Score: 11)\n* r/IndieGaming - 432 views (Score: 3)\n* r/IndieDev - 450 views (Score: 3)\n* r/GameDevPromotion - 207 views (Score: 1)\n\nA lot of places i posted to had the posts immediately cut off even if they allowed self-promotion, which killed some of my efforts. See my takeaways below for more on this.\n\n**What i found out from the month:**\n\n* People upvoting/liking/showing interest doesn't necessarily mean wishlists. Obvious to say, but good to have direct evidence.\n* Niche subreddits are more likely to get better results (approximately 20 of my wishlists come from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RenPy/comments/1kikgke/making_a_navigation_system_within_renpy_can/), which got 4.7k views and a score of 54. It's natural that the RenPy community are going to be more curious about someone tweaking the RenPy game engine in a way it doesn't usually go. Even then, high reddit views/score doesn't mean a fantastic result.\n* Outside the niches, the more general indie subreddits are essentially pointless. /u/klausbrusselssprouts did some followup research on this after my last post on it and it confirms what i've been suspecting. Places like r/IndieGaming, r/IndieGames and r/GameDevPromotion are basically illusionary subreddits nowadays. They mostly contain other developers trying to promote themselves, so while you might catch some interest, it'll only be in passing. This is the problem i alluded to earlier. Game promotion is walled off in a lot of places. There are a lot of 'here is a section to promote your game' places on reddit and Discord. The only people showing up at these places are people who want to promote *their* game, and they rarely have the time to look at yours.\n* I think this has further led to something that's more well known on this subreddit, the plague of developers trying to subtly promote their game by bringing it up in conversation or providing single screenshots. I'm part of this plague and i won't deny it. The sad thing being that it feels we have little choice in the matter but to do this to get any kind of visibility. I feel it's a matter of perspective though. One way, it feels like you're being sneaky, the other, when it works you get some pretty positive discussion behind your game.\n\n**Takeaways/future plans**\n\n* An appealing genre would probably help a lot in these early stages. I may have shot myself in the foot by going for 'dark comedy narrative point and click with a minimalistic hand drawn demake art style'. While i do believe the game i've made is good and i can see that there are people out there seeing it and liking it, it's a hard game to promote. The game grew organically out of a side project and has reached a point where i both can't and don't want to upheave it. My next project is going to have a lot more focus in those early stages to have something with more appeal to it.\n* Honestly, the 'Hey, this game exists' adverts were frustrating and it starts to feel very cringy when you have to condense the entire game into a tagline and hope that gets people to look at the trailer. It feels like you're screaming into a void. They also have little to no success even compared to my other bad results. I don't think they're a good idea.\n* It's much more interesting and effective to post about the more unique parts of your game and try to drum up conversation about that. Discord and the niche subreddits were the better place to be.\n* The more niche the subreddit, the more successful the results.\n* The more successful wishlist gamedev posts seem to agree with this. For example, u/Hot-Persimmon-9768's method of promotion was to regularly post updates about features to a handful of subreddits, and this has been very successful for them. From this point on, i think this is going to be one of my main methods of promotion.\n* At this point it's hard to tell if this means my game is 'screwed' or not. Maybe it was always going to be, or maybe my intended redirection will bring better results. If you don't hear from me ever again, assume the former...\n\nSo in the end my first month was kind of a failure. From this point on my aim is going to be more on promoting elements of my game within niche locations rather than the more generic advertising on the more general locations (which as i type, seems really obvious, but i guess you only find out for certain when you do it yourself). If you got this far, thanks for reading (and hey, maybe consider [wishlisting my game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3066100/Feeding_The_Velociraptors/) :) )",

Help others and get help in return! \n\nI am currently working on a website to share the game Dev secrets we all wish we knew when we started.\n\n\n\nI’ll go first.\nI’ve always wanted to make a game. I was never a strong at reading, writing/spelling. I never thought I’d be able to code.\nOne day on YouTube I found a video by change something along the “make your first game in 1 hour” something along that line. I listened to it and started going down a rabbit hole starting to get inspired to make my first game. Eventually I heard of unreal engine. Thinking I could do this because it was more visual scripting than writing code, I download the engine. \nHundreds of hours of YouTube later I was proud of what I have made. Then it came to learning more advanced concepts and systems and started to become discouraged. Eventually I powered through it and finished those systems. At this point I had enough of a game for someone to play it. I wanted to share the year of my life’s free time working on this project and started joining discords of the content creators I’ve been watching. From here a couple discords and people have really stood out.Those people have further inspired me with their feedback. That leads me to where my project is here today 1 year 7 months with about 1,700 hours after the start of my project. Along the way I have found so many people, websites, videos, so much more that have inspired or helped me when I was stuck. Recently I am at the point where I need to be social and get my game name out into the universe. There is a discord channel that held an event Devs x streamers ( I think it was this Reddit actually) I have joined for the first time and hung out for a few HOURS. I have met so many awesome people. They all had their own stories and I listened with their achievements and their struggles thinking “oh yeah me too, man I wish there was something out there to show us the way”. Now with new inspiration I’m setting out to build the ultimate game Dev library. I’d like it to be a place for everyone to come together  and share what they know or found useful for others struggling on that subject. I could rank Le for ever but I’d leave it with this. I am currently in the building process ( maybe 1 week into it) of the website. But there right now you can find those places I’ve found useful and the people I’ve followed. (Website is in profile it’s not flushed out or well designed to everything is under the learning materials tab. It NEEDS a new landing page because it was used to download a demo of my game so be kind if you were to check it out. I’m not sure if it’s a gray area to post in the post).\nBut if you could post the resources with the post so we can all see/use them would be awesome! And I’d love to use them on my website.",

Quick rundown of my client sources:\nGot all my clients so far from Indian startup subreddits. The only issue being that Indian clients, especially at the startup stages are less paying than the normal market standards. My first ever client which I got from an Indian startup subreddit was for a meagre 25 USD. I'm not complaining as I had only 2-3 sites on my portfolio at that time, and he did give me referral to a client from which I charged around 40 USD. These offered me a good stepping stones for my next client (charged around 95 usd) and now I'm charging over 100 dollars and got immensely better at this thing. But because of my \"high\" rates in the Indian ecosystems, I have very few frequency of the clients coming in and also some do not end up publishing the site because the tech stack that I use i.e Framer, costs monthly plans which are sometimes unaffordable for my clients. I have decided to skip Indian clients and focus on international clients.\nTried Fiverr and Upwork, but the hyper competitive landscape there is killing me. I apply to a job every month on upwork through the monthly free connects that I get, but I manage to get no responses so far. I do think that my portfolio is decent and the websites I make are also pretty decent looking but ofcourse, I strive to make it better and upskill myself. I also tried cold emailing a few companies with their website revamps but got no reply. I also find this process to be unproductive as you're spending your time for revamping someone's website who might not need a revamp for a bunch of reasons, also it's unnecessary expenditure for them as most people think in the terms of \"it's okay as long as it's functioning\" and give lesser regards to design and ux. It's also hard to determine what they actually need or what their vision with the website is without even talking to them. Plus it's also difficult to determine if they would be willing to change their current tech stack.\nI have tried several different ways to find clients but have been unsuccessful in a lot of them so far.\n\nSo how and where do I actually find clients?",

Hi there!  \nI know its quite the open question but let me give you some context.\n\nSo I've been practicing my frontend skills lately as they have been my weak point for a while now.  \nI've read some books and I am currently just copying videos to see what people do in order to make designs.\n\nBut I feel like there is something that I am missing.\n\nWhen developing backend and practicing for it. What I would do is just... That.  \nI would read books I would see videos, read code.\n\nAnd see what I liked what implementation looked better to me and just did that. And obviously while searching for it I would see how different implementation and try them out.\n\nCreating my own portfolio.\n\nNow with frontend I am struggling to see the same success.  \nBooks help me structure and systematize my development. But I always end up being stuck and not being sure how to proceed.\n\nRight now as I am still working on videos and seeing what people do. I just wish there was some resource or just something to give that base for me to start developing real and \"good\" looking apps.\n\nI've been trying to learn more animations. Trying GSAP now that is free.  \nLearning about design itself. And just copying a page a day from [land-book.com](http://land-book.com)  \nI am improving I know that.\n\nBut for some reason I can't put it together. I can't just have a structured path as I have with the backend or have that mental path. Where is like. I will do these basic animations I will do a hero with these things.\n\nI guess one way to put it is with the 20/80 rule. You will use 20% of the things 80% of the time.  \nI am struggling to find my 20%.\n\nAs you can see, I am struggling and I am fairly new when it comes to both design and frontend.  \nI want to get better. So if anyone has any advice, resource or guidance into how to truly become a great Frontend developer I would really appreciate it.\n\nThank you for your time!",

I’m pretty new to Figma and currently exploring tools that can help me turn my designs into functional code—basically looking for something that bridges the gap from static mockups to working UI components.\n\nSo far, I’ve come across a couple of options:\n\n* [**Figma MCP**](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP) – Looked interesting at first, but honestly feels a bit clunky. Requires setting up your own server, which is already a red flag for me. Also saw some chatter around potential security issues and it seems kind of barebones feature-wise.  \n* [**Anima**](https://www.animaapp.com/) – Tried it recently and it feels a lot more polished. It’s embedded right into Figma, supports things like interactive components, responsive breakpoints, and exports React/Vue/HTML code that’s actually readable. It even handles things like text styles and layout fidelity better than I expected. The AI editing is also good.  \n\nI’m leaning towards Anima for now just because it seems to *just work* without needing server gymnastics.\n\nThat said—I'm curious if there are other tools I should be checking out before I go all-in. Anyone using anything else for design-to-code workflows? Especially tools that play nice with teams or handle complex UIs well?",

I have encountered a team breakdown in my recent project and as a self reflection, I thought of learning from everyone else how to manage the situation.\n\nSo I was engaged by a friend to be her website designer while she leads the project as the Project Manager under her new company. She also engaged a web developer. At the beginning, before sending my design options for the webpage to the client, the three of us would jump into a meeting to review the design and the other two would propose the changes.\n\nWhen she presented the design to the client, the client loves the options and chose one. Then. the nightmare begins. The client started nitpicking and art direct the design. My Project Manager passed their feedbacks to me. And I followed through, occasionally giving feedbacks on things that don't work but my Project Manager said to just do it to show client. \n\nSadly by round 4-5, my Project Manager started saying the design looked toned down and then got her client to visually show what they want by learning Figma. She sent me the design that client has made and asked me to use that as reference.\n\nBy this round, I highlighted to her its quite hard to blame me for the bad design since client has become the art director. I was trying to hint to my Project Manager that she needs to actually say no to client or at least loop me in to the meeting. Anyway, my Project Manager sent a passive aggressive message to the team chat, accusing me for not trying hard enough. \n\nTo be fair, I did stop trying cause the timeline was short and this is my freelance gig and I recently also found out my payment is below market rate. Also the most creative design I had done for this project had already been stripped down. I was not sure how else to be creative.\n\nSo my question is:  \nHow do you guys say no to client that are becoming the art directors?",

    "chunk_text": "How do experienced designers get started on designs? I'm a long term backend developer with experience in frontend. I often create web projects to help out friends, or to create simple tools for personal use. While I've found I have a good eye for improving on existing designs (giving feedback to a designer at work, or doing work on an existing site), I've always struggled when it comes to creating a new site from scratch. I try to google for website inspirations, but most of the time it ends up being landing pages or simple sites that have a few pages with a bunch of text/images. I don't really get how it inspires new design, specially if the site I'm working on involves a lot of user interaction. I've used color schema generators in the past, and while it's helped me find interesting colors to consider in my designs, it hasn't helped me come up with a complete schema/pattern. For example, I recently created a simple site to help me track grocery shopping. At first, it was literally black and white until I randomly tried a color for a border and it worked. Bursts of inspiration are fine, but don't make for professional output. I especially find color inspiration to be difficult.\n\nSo I'm left with (as far as I see), one of two conclusions: I'm not cut out for design (which is fine, just like not everyone can be a backend dev) or there's more to designs from the ground up that I don't know. If anyone has any thoughts, books, tutorials, videos, etc they can recommend, I'd love it. I currently have an unlimited access account to udemy, so can hop onto anything there. Having worked with many designers, I know I'll never be a great designer, but I also feel like I'm missing something for doing basic design, and I'm not sure what it is.",

    "chunk_text": "CSS Fragmentation issues with multi column After reading [When and How to Use CSS Multi-Column Layout](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/css-multiple-column-layout-multicol/), I tried to use it for building a masonry layout.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afue7wa4ov0f1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8342a415d87046cfb60b43c855b891e615b1e51\n\nWhile there is a `grid-template-rows: masonry`, it is not widely available in 2025. I wanted a single column of items on mobile, and 300px wide columns added as the viewport allowed. Items would have auto width and height, and allow the columns to determine width:\n\n    #container {\n      columns: 300px;\n      gap: 1em; /* inline axis gutter */\n    }\n    \n    .item {\n      box-shadow: mintcream 3px 3px;\n      margin-bottom: 1em; /* block axis gutter */\n    }\n    \n    <div id=\"container\">\n      <div class=\"item\">First</div>\n      <div class=\"item\">Second, with more stuff</div>\n      <div class=\"item\">Third, and a whole lotta more so it wraps when viewport is small</div>\n      <div class=\"items\">Fourth, because why not</div>\n    </div>\n\nThis worked great! Kinda. But then I noticed an extra line and gap would appear in the new column when the viewport widened. It didn't show up in the web inspector, but some fiddling narrowed down `box-shadow` to cause the unwanted line, and `margin-bottom` to cause the excess gap. This only occured on Safari (mobile and desktop). I found several related issues on bugzilla, but the ones with the most context are:\n\n* [Bug 14137: box-shadow on element inside multi-column doesn't draw outside column boundary](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14137#c17)\n* [Bug 104944: CSS Fragmentation Implement correct margin truncation at breaks](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104944#c9)\n\nI've linked to my comments with the reproduction HTML and CSS.\n\nI was open to removing the box-shadow or changing it to an inset shadow, but the [CSS fragmentation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/css-fragmentation/) bug affecting margins is a dealbreaker because it causes the boxes to not line up at the top for multiple columns. I tried using [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) by setting `margin-block: 2.5em`, which collapsed fine within the same column, but didn't work on the first item of the new column. I also tried to wrap my items and use padding for gutters rather than margins, but padding would also push into the top of new columns (womp womp).\n\nMulti-column is still useful for prose, and content that doesn't require alignment, but unfortunately does not work in Safari for a masonry layout of cards. Long term, using the masonry grid layout is the right way to go, but I was hoping this would provide a simple CSS-only fallback.\n\nI settled on a responsive 3-column [masonry layout with flexbox](https://jch.app/demo). It works for this design because I have a fixed number of tiles, but would not be a good fit for a layout with dynamic number of elements (e.g. image gallery)",

What are some do's and don'ts in regards to their portfolio? Hello, folks.\n\nI am due to finish up nearly 6 years of study. \n\nUnder my belt I have got:\n\n* A graphic design bachelors with a major in web design, and thesis done on UI conventions. \n* I have a UI/UX diploma, accredited by my uni but it was essentially a bootcamp. \n* A digital marketing certificate from CourseCareers and a certificate from Google (this is the part I am finishing up in the next 2 weeks)\n* I have learned 2 web building tools (Ycode and Framer)\n* Spline, Hana (Spline), Rive, Lotties, and Adobe Suite.\n* Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS, enough to read it.\n* Business course from a local enterprise office.\n\nI have a goal to either be part of the management team within several years, and to run/own an agency within \\~10 years, but for now it makes more sense to join one to gain knowledge and experience, and to start building my network.\n\nAnd so my questions are:\n\n1. What do you look for in a candidate when they apply for a job?\n2. What are some do's and don'ts in regards to their portfolio? \n\nFor example some of the concerns that I have:\n\nAfter bachelors but before diploma I took a break from the educational grind. I've traveled for work around Europe. I can imagine some employers not liking the fact that I was absent from the industry for around 4 years. Others may see it differently, because after all, not everyone can pack up everything they own and move to a different country. I could argue that this has thought me to not fear change and obstacles. It thought me a lot of soft people's skills. Personally, I feel like I should outline this in my portfolio. But what do you think?\n\nI have also been a front-of-the-house manager in a hospitality business. Sure, that is unrelated in terms of industry. But managing people is still an experience. Do you think I should outline that in my portfolio as well?\n\nI am happy to hear all of your thoughts and suggestions.\n\nThank you kindly!",

Patients miss appointments, get lost, or delay care simply because they don’t know where to go. At the same time, hospital staff lose valuable time giving directions, managing confused patients, or dealing with bottlenecks at key entrances and desks.\n\nWhat STRIDE Does:\n\t\n1. Patients get step-by-step directions from entrance to their specific clinic, imaging department, or patient room\n\n2. Optional layers for accessibility routing, multi-language support, or low-stimulation pathways (neurodiverse-friendly)\n\t\n3. Integrated mobile check-in and appointment reminders\n\n4. Wait time display and movement tracking for improved flow\n\n5. Self-service backend: hospital uploads floor plan, tags key destinations, and STRIDE handles the rest\n\nFor Hospitals:\n\nReduces missed or delayed appointments. Cuts front-desk time spent on giving directions. Improves Press Ganey/patient satisfaction scores. Works as a layer on top of their existing systems, no deep rebuilds required. Scales easily across multiple buildings or locations\n\nDifferentiation:\n\nMost players in this space are:\n\t•\tEnterprise-only\n\t•\tFocused on IT leaders\n\t•\tComplex and slow to deploy\n\t•\tBuilt for desktops or kiosks, not phones\n\nSTRIDE is different  because it’s clean, mobile-first, and designed to be implemented fast, especially for hospitals that don’t have a million-dollar IT budget.\n\nMy Ask:\n\n1. If you work in health tech, operations, or patient experience, does this solve a real problem?\n\n2.\tIf you’ve been a lost patient or had a parent stuck trying to find the right department, would something like this help?\n\t\n3. Is there a red flag I’m missing?\n\t\n4. Would love intros to hospital administrators, outpatient clinics, or anyone building tech in this space.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts and happy to go deeper if there’s interest.",

Hey all\n\nI’m working on a Chrome extension that goes beyond basic font identification (like WhatFont). \n\nI’ve built a prototype that lets you click on any font on a site, then test it with your own text, adjust font size, line spacing, kerning, foreground/background colors, etc. \n\nIt’s been a passion project, and now I’m trying to figure out what else would make it truly useful for designers, developers and type lovers in general.  \n\nCurious:\n\t•\tWhat frustrates you about current tools like WhatFont or Fontface Ninja?\n\t•\tWould features like “find similar fonts,” direct download/purchase links, or font pairing suggestions be helpful?\n\t•\tAny wishlist features you’ve never seen but would love to have?\n\nWould love any thoughts…trying to build something genuinely useful here. \n\nThanks in advance!",

(I often talk to ChatGPT when I am depressed. I always found the replies too \"Machiney\". Also I am looking for a job and so ChatGPT and I cooked something up. Hopefully it helps.\n\nP.S. The name Sonny is my inspiration from the movie I,Robot )\n\n**About Me**:\n\nHey folks,\n\nI’ve been working on a little side project I call *Project Sonny* — it’s all about making AI responses feel like they come from a real friend instead of a machine or a therapist.\n\nWe all know how frustrating canned “positive” replies can be when you’re having a tough time. So I rewrote some typical AI responses to sound more honest, raw, and human — like someone who’s been there and gets it.\n\n**Purpose:** To showcase a human-first, emotionally aware approach to AI communication, making responses feel like they come from a real friend — not a therapist or machine.\n\n**Tone:** Honest. Warm. Empathetic. Direct. A little raw. Like someone who *knows* what it feels like.\n\n# Scenario 1 – Feeling Stuck\n\nUser: “I’m trying so hard but nothing is working. I feel like I’m stuck in life.”\n\nTypical AI Response:  \n“It sounds like you’re going through a tough time. Maybe try breaking your goals down into smaller steps.”\n\nProject Sonny Rewrite:  \n“Ya I know, like pushing through an invisible wall. No matter what you do you are always stuck. Can we talk about this in detail? Let’s step back and take a broader view of the issue.”\n\n# Scenario 2 – Rejection\n\nUser: “I didn’t get the job. Again. I’m starting to feel like I’ll never be good enough.”\n\nTypical AI Response:  \n“I’m sorry to hear that. Don’t give up, something will work out soon.”\n\nProject Sonny Rewrite:  \n“Ohh, what happened? That kind of thing just chips away at you, huh? Let’s talk about it.”\n\n# Scenario 3 – Burnout\n\nUser: “I’ve been working nonstop and I just feel empty. I don’t even know why I’m doing this anymore.”\n\nTypical AI Response:  \n“It sounds like you may be experiencing burnout. Try to take some time to rest and reflect on your goals.”\n\nProject Sonny Rewrite:  \n“It does feel unfair. You’ve been pouring everything in, and now there’s nothing left to give. It's not your fault. Lets sit and figure out. You are doing fine.”\n\n# Scenario 4 – Loneliness\n\nUser: “I don’t think anyone really cares about me. I just feel invisible.”\n\nTypical AI Response:  \n“I’m really sorry you feel that way. Remember, there are people who care about you even if it doesn't seem like it.”\n\nProject Sonny Rewrite:  \n“Yeah, that might feel bad. Like you’re around people but still not really seen. Want to talk about what’s been going on lately?”\n\n# Scenario 5 – Self-Doubt\n\nUser: “I don’t think I’m good enough for anything. I always mess things up.”\n\nTypical AI Response:  \n“It’s important to be kind to yourself. Everyone makes mistakes and it’s part of learning.”\n\nProject Sonny Rewrite:  \n“Can understand. That loop in your head that keeps telling you you’re not enough? It lies. Let’s shut it up together.”\n\n# Final Note\n\nThis isn’t about perfect words or polished replies — it’s about *real connection*. If this portfolio made you pause, nod, or even feel a tiny bit less alone, then *Project Sonny* is doing its job.",

I'm building a \"scenario based\" learning tool for people to improve their organisational judgement using real life situations.  At the moment I've focused just on assembling the scenarios (description, supporting links, and answer).   Screenshot here (it's extremely early MVP):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oepxsfj6ujye1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=a915015523915cf79d0bb4c9b454e133c7c907af\n\nThe issue I have is that this is a tonne of information to consume.  Read a description, click links to read more descriptions,  type your long form answer, get another long form answer and easily ends up being 10-15 pages per scenario.  I could shorten the scenarios a bit, write them more succinctly, but the reality is the situations are complex and the context is really important (it's the whole point).\n\nHow should I be thinking about simplifying / making this more palatable? Looking for more of a high level user experience, not just a \"split the answer up behind a 'read more' modal\" or something.  Here's what I've considered so far:\n\n* Video, obviously.  Put the answer into a video so that removes at least one text element.\n* I considered doing something like Duolingo with bite sized questions or asking individual questions and showing a checkmark when you complete each one (which I think is a good idea) but the scenarios are complex, you still need to consume all of the context.  I could go through and select all the relevant parts from the links, and show you 6-7 snippets, but part of the exercise is identifying those aspects yourself.\n* Making it like a \"detective\" game where it imports the text of the article natively and you go over it with a highlighting tool and later it scores you on what you identified (so you still have to read all the text, but at least it's interactive).\n\n  \nWould appreciate your thoughts.  Links to examples etc would be brilliant.  Thanks a lot and have a great weekend!",

It’s 2025 and somehow we still can't fine-tune volume on apps used by billions.\n\nAmazon isn't much better, either.

While my role leaned heavily into UI (since they didn’t have a dedicated designer before), I had full ownership of all design decisions, from visual direction to UX flows.\n\nSome context:\n\n- I redesigned their entire website from scratch (it had very rough initial layouts).\n\n- I also built their complete mobile app (they had some basic agency-designed screens, but I reworked most of it).\n\n- I collaborated closely with devs and PMs, but the design direction was mine entirely.\n\n\nThe problem now?  \nI didn’t really document anything with a portfolio in mind. I have tons of Figma files, iterations, and final designs, but they’re messy and huge. I’m not sure how to structure them into a compelling case study or what to focus on. I can reach out to devs/managers to gather metrics or testimonials if needed.\n\nWould love to hear from this community:\n\n- How do I turn this into a strong, focused case study?\n\n- How much should I show (especially when the project is massive)?\n\n- Any smart ways to simplify this or present it in a portfolio?\n\n- Examples from others who did something similar?\n\n\nThanks in advance!

Slower charging, slightly lower battery life - (but still lasts a full workday)\n3. Inferior speakers vs. Pro - (but still very solid)\n\nMacBook Pro 14.2” (M4):\n\nPros:\n1. Brighter Liquid Retina XDR display (HDR support)\n2. ProMotion (120Hz refresh rate)\n3. Better speakers & better cooling for sustained performance\n\nCons:\n1.

    "chunk_text": "Why do companies push so hard for users to sign up? Hey,\nI'm building a small product myself right now and I'm reworking the first user experience/ Auth process. I'm wondering why other companies push so hard for sign ups before you can even use the app.\n\nInstead of a sign-up process with email or a 3rd party provider, you could give your users a randomly generated token that he is recognized by until he signed up.\n\nAs example:\n- Spotify: you could still listen to music without an account. Spotify could still earn money from giving you ads. Spotify could still generate Daily Mix, Discover Weekly and similar based on the preferences stored alongside that token.\n- Amazon: You could purchase something easily by entering your email, address and payment details. Tracking and other stuff is possible by sending confirmation details to the user.\n\n\nOne interesting way I saw Auth being handled is by flixtrain. You get an email with a button that redirects you to your ticket. Upon opening the link, you have to enter your email address and the unique booking number. voilà, you have all your data.\n\nI think with every time you force a user into signing up before using your product you loose a percentage in the funnel. Some will just close the page and say: nah I'm not gonna sign up.\n\nSo I'm curious what this sub thinks about the points and examples I mentioned about Auth?",

My team and I do more “UX Strategy” with product a mix of research, quantitative user data of our site to understand AB tests and day to day site usage, and competitive type research to help inform product and designers. \n\nWhat bugs me is that my career has never really needed me to do hardcore user research or design. I  know the way around both, but my time growing into a more people manager has taken me away from day to day work. I don’t do pure product management at my job since there’s a team now for that, but a lot of what I do to inform work probably is more like product management. \n\nSo when I look at jobs I feel like I can’t match anything right, and worry that if I ever get hit in a layoff that I would be just ruined with so much “experience” but “no experience”. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for what I should work to?

The user also wants to be able to exclude that tag and show only results that don't include it. Finally there is the neutral state where it shows results regardless of if it has that tag or not.\n\nI quite like the way that airbnb lets users filter search results by tag, using a list of chips for the user to click. e.g. if they require property with that some amenities, they can select more than one chip from this list: [image](https://i.imgur.com/tSugK4p.png). However this method only lets the user include that tag and doesn't let them exclude it.\n\nI'm trying to figure out if there is a conventional or intuitive way for a chip to have three states: only, exclude, or neutral.\n\nMy first thought is to let users click once for only, twice to exclude, then click it a third time to go back to neutral. An icon or strikethrough would indicate if the tag is being excluded. My concern is that users might not discover that they can do this, or they might accidentally exclude it when they think it's simply deselected if they aren't paying attention to the icon/strikethrough or don't know what it means. I'd probably have to put instructions somewhere so that they understand.\n\nEdit: just realised another option might be to have an arrow icon at the end of the chip, which opens up a dropdown and lets the user select to include or exclude, a bit like how Gnome does it: [image](https://i.imgur.com/nIscB7g.png). Though with several chips in a row, it could be a bit cluttered.\n\nIs there a better way or could this work? I haven't been able to find examples of this on other sites.\n\nThanks.",

This is a new team that has been tasked with creating a new web application. Prior to this team's creation our IS department has not had much focus on creating high quality, user focused, products, and were typically driven by business needs and engineering. This has created problems regarding UX, design consistency, and accessibility. The IS department has realized this and explicitly created this team to focus on delivering a quality user experience.\n\n**Problem**\n\nOur IS department wants to get features into the hands of users as soon as possible, and the plan is to develop this web app \"page by page\" delivering MVP level pages and features which we can revisit and improve iteratively.\n\nBut our design resources are beholden to guidelines from their design department, which requires extensive UX research and senior design reviews that take 4-6 weeks. Because these design reviews require evaluating the entire user experience, start-to-finish, as a whole. From my understanding they WILL NOT allow any MVP level work to be approved. The designers won't even share the unapproved WIP work.\n\nThere's obviously a mis-match of priorities between the IS and Design departments.\n\nThis effectively makes delivering any MPV impracticable and now we have a bunch of developers with literally nothing to do.\n\n**Question**\n\nIs this design process typical? It feels very \"waterfall\" and doesn't allow for any iterative work. It's like Design wants a \"perfect solution\" before signing off on anything.",

I'm trying to improve my work, especially when it comes to accessibility. From what I have read, the general best practice is to open links on the same page rather than opening a new tab. However like any rule there are corner cases and exceptions. I'm hoping someone can help me determine if I have encountered one of those.\n\nThe application I am working on is a messaging platform. The user fills out a form with the message they want to submit and when they want it to display. When they are done, they are sent to a preview screen where they can review their message and either submit it for moderation or return to the previous screen to make changes.\n\nBoth screens have a pair of hyperlinks, one to a content rules document and the other to an external site for scheduling event reservations. For the first screen (the create view) opening the links in the same screen works fine. In the second screen ( the preview view) if they click on one of the links and then try to return to the original page they will get an annoying page from the browser asking them to resubmit the form.\n\nSo the question then is what linking behavior to use. Are pages that required a form to be resubmitted an exception to the rules? If I change the links on the preview page to open new tabs, do I need to do the same on the create page to keep things consistent?",

    "chunk_text": "Introducing new Announcements APIs Hi devs,\n\nWe’ll be adding a new set of endpoints to our Data API for reading Reddit Announcements. These new APIs are available for you to integrate with starting today, and will start returning data in 90 days. We will share more details about this change and the exact timing in a subsequent update. \n\n**What are Reddit announcements**\n\nAnnouncements are non-repliable Reddit-official messages that are currently sent as private messages. This includes:\n\n* Updates about Reddit policies and settings\n* Communications about account and content status\n* Marketing updates about products or events\n\nThe announcement APIs can be used to receive and read notifications sent from Reddit. \n\n**How announcements work**\n\nAnnouncements will appear as notifications in the notifications section of the inbox (i.e. the bell icon) on the native Reddit apps. When selected, these messages will be expandable to view in their entirety. \n\n**Why are we making this change?**\n\nWe want to make it easier for users to distinguish between non-repliable messages and official updates they receive from Reddit, from repliable messages they receive from other users, subreddits, and bots on the platform. \n\n**Migrating your apps**\n\nDevelopers should update their integrations within 90 days. If changes aren’t made within this time frame, nothing will break, but your app will not receive Reddit announcements and may miss critical communications. Announcements API documentation can be found below. \n\n**Documentation**\n\nScope required: `announcements`\n\nGET **/api/announcements/v1**\n\n**→ /api/announcements/v1/unread**\n\nFetch announcements from Reddit.\n\n|after|(beta) fullname of an announcement, prefixed ann\\_|\n|:-|:-|\n|before|(beta) fullname of an announcement, prefixed ann\\_|\n|limit|an integer between 1 and 100|\n\nPOST **/api/announcements/v1/hide**\n\nAccepts a list of announcement fullnames (ann\\_) and marks them hidden if they belong to the authenticated user\n\n|ids|(beta) comma separated list of announcement fullnames, prefixed ann\\_|\n|:-|:-|\n\n\nPOST **/api/announcements/v1/read**\n\nAccepts a list of announcement fullnames (ann\\_) and marks them hidden if they belong to the authenticated user\n\n|ids|(beta) comma separated list of announcement fullnames, prefixed ann\\_(beta) comma separated list of announcement fullnames, prefixed ann\\_|\n|:-|:-|\n\n\nPOST **/api/announcements/v1/read\\_all**\n\nMarks all unread announcements as read for the authenticated user\n\n***To test these endpoints, please*** [***fill out this form with your username***](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQQeiHvfiSV7xZwnueIIeMF5A_nIY1jdUS1ZbAR5Z-RX8SlQ/viewform?usp=header) ***so we can enroll you in the testing period.***",

Need guidance on cookie-based authentication I've built an open-source tool called Reddit-Migrate that helps users transfer their data between Reddit accounts, and I want to make sure I'm fully compliant with Reddit's API terms and policies before promoting it further.\n\n# What the Tool Does\n\n**Reddit-Migrate** allows users to transfer:\n\n* Subreddit subscriptions\n* Saved posts\n* Followed users\n\nFrom one Reddit account to another, running entirely locally on the user's machine.\n\n# Technical Implementation Details\n\n**Authentication Method:**\n\n* Uses cookie-based authentication (user provides their own Reddit cookies)\n* No OAuth app registration required from users\n* Cookies are processed locally - never sent to external servers\n\n**API Usage:**\n\n* Uses official Reddit API endpoints:\n   * `/api/me.json` for account verification\n   * `/subreddits/mine/subscriber` for fetching subscriptions\n   * `/api/subscribe` for subscribing to subreddits\n   * `/user/{username}/saved` for saved posts\n   * `/api/save` for saving posts\n   * Similar endpoints for user follows\n\n**Rate Limiting:**\n\n* Implements delays between API calls to respect rate limits\n* Batches requests where possible (e.g., 100 subreddits per batch)\n* Large migrations can take several minutes due to conservative rate limiting\n\n**Privacy/Security:**\n\n* Tool runs on localhost:5005\n* All data processing happens locally\n* No external servers involved\n* User cookies never leave their machine\n\n# Specific Policy Questions\n\n1. **Cookie Authentication**: Is using user-provided cookies for API access compliant? The tool doesn't store or transmit these cookies anywhere.\n2. **Bulk Operations**: Does transferring hundreds of saved posts/subscriptions violate any bulk usage policies, even with rate limiting?\n3. **Account Migration Use Case**: Is helping users migrate their own data between their own accounts an acceptable use case?\n4. **Distribution**: Is it okay to distribute this as open-source software for users to run locally?\n5. **API Terms Compliance**: Are there any specific terms I should be aware of that might affect this use case?\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* Tool is intended for personal use only (users migrating their own data)\n* No commercial use or data collection\n* Respects rate limits and implements delays\n* Users must provide their own cookies (tool doesn't scrape or hack anything)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/nileshnk/reddit-migrate](https://github.com/nileshnk/reddit-migrate)\n\nI've read through the [API Terms](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), but I'd appreciate guidance from the community on whether this implementation raises any red flags.\n\n**Main concern**: I want to ensure the cookie-based authentication approach and bulk migration functionality don't inadvertently violate any policies.\n\nThanks for any insights! Happy to provide more technical details if needed.\n\n**TL;DR**: Built a local tool that uses Reddit cookies to migrate user data between accounts. Want to confirm it's policy-compliant before wider release.",

The reason im building this is cuz i wanted to have an app where i could browse and come up with business ideas using those pain points for myself as i cant pay for gummy search :( since reddit provides their API for developers i thought it would be cool to use it for myself !\n\ni wanted some advice on how to display errors for example when api requests are exhausted for example   \nheres some of my code\n\nheres where im getting the access token\n\n```\nconst getAccessToken = async () => {\n  const credentials = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString(\n    \"base64\",\n  );\n\n  const res = await fetch(\"https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    headers: {\n      Authorization: `Basic ${credentials}`,\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\n      \"User-Agent\": userAgent,\n    },\n    body: new URLSearchParams({ grant_type: \"client_credentials\" }),\n  });\n\n  const data = await res.json();\n  return data.access_token;\n};\n\n```\n\nand heres where im fetching posts from a bunch of subreddits\n\n```\nconst fetchPost = async (req, res) => {\n  const sort = req.body.sort || \"hot\";\n  const subs = req.body.subreddits;\n\n// pain keywords for filtering\n\n  const painKeywords = [\n    \"i hate\",\n    \"so frustrating\",\n    \"i struggle with\",\n  ];\n\n  const token = await getAccessToken();\n\n  let allPosts = [];\n\n  for (const sub of subs) {\n    const redditRes = await fetch(\n      `https://oauth.reddit.com/r/${sub}/${sort}?limit=50`,\n      {\n        headers: {\n          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,\n          \"User-Agent\": userAgent,\n        },\n      },\n    );\n\n    const data = await redditRes.json();\n\n    console.log(\"reddit res\", data.data.children.length);\n    const filteredPosts = data.data.children\n      .filter((post) => {\n        const { title, selftext, author, distinguished } = post.data;\n        if (author === \"AutoModerator\" || distinguished === \"moderator\")\n          return false;\n\n        const content = `${title} ${selftext}`.toLowerCase();\n        return painKeywords.some((kw) => content.includes(kw));\n      })\n      .map((post) => ({\n        title: post.data.title,\n        url: `https://reddit.com${post.data.permalink}`,\n        subreddit: sub,\n        upvotes: post.data.ups,\n        comments: post.data.num_comments,\n        author: post.data.author,\n        flair: post.data.link_flair_text,\n        selftext: post.data.selftext,\n      }));\n    console.log(\"filtered posts\", filteredPosts);\n\n    allPosts.push(...filteredPosts);\n  }\n\n  return res.json(allPosts);\n};\n\n```\nhow could i show some a neat error message if the user is requesting way too much (like return a json back to client \"try again later\"?) for example a lot of subreddits? ive tested this out and when my subreddit array in the for loop is >15 i get an error that `children` is undefined and my server crashes but it works when my subreddit array in the for loop is <=15 subreddits now i assume its cuz my api requests are exhausted? i tried console logging the `redditRes` headers and it does show my api limits are like 997.0 or something like that close to 1000 im quite confused as i thought it was 60 queries per minute? btw im getting back 50 posts per subreddit, not sure if thats an issue, id like someone to shed some light on this as its my first time using the reddit API!\n\nAlso id like some guidance on how i could really filter posts by pain points just like Gummy Search! idk how they do it, but as u can see in my code ive got an array of `\"pain keywords\"` now this is highly inefficient as i only get back 5-6 posts that pass my filter, any suggestions on how i could filter posts by pain points accurately? i was thinking of using the openAI SDK for example to pass the json with a prompt returned by reddit to openAI to filter for pain points and return only those posts that have pain points? im not sure if that would work also since my json would be huge right since im getting back 50 posts per subreddit? not sure if openAI would be able to do something like that for me \n\nappreciate any help and advice thank you!",

First off, is it generally better to use PRAW over the official API? I see a lot of mentions of PRAW and I guess as a wrapper that seems more featured this is the way to go if I'm fine with python which I am.\n\n\nAlso, I’m planning to automate some of my Reddit activity for personal projects, not making any public apps or releases just using it with my personal account—like posting my monthly status updates or sending messages based on certain triggers. Like say I want to buy a PS5 I might write something that messages someone if they have a PS5 for sale in my local subreddit or whatever (but putting in some controls so I don't send out 100 messages if suddenly a bunch of PS5s are for sale).\n\n\nNot trying to do any mass actions or anything sketchy, just streamline and add some automation to some behaviour I would be doing manually as a user anyway. \n\n\nI’m a bit surprised Reddit allows this kind of automation, but I guess in hindsight its obvious with all the spelling correction and other random bots lurking around. \n\nA big part of why I'm asking is I'd want to use this with my main account (this one) and just trying to make sure I don't do anything unintentionally that gets it banned or something since this account is a pretty big chunk of my online legacy 😬 \n\nThanks for any insights!",

As far as I can tell, there's no way to do that without just retrieving all comments and filtering them by created date, so I've been looking into how to do that.\n\nI found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/12f885c/getting_all_the_comments_in_a_post/) about doing the same thing, and I started looking into the RedditWarp library that's mentioned there. Unfortunately I'm working in C# so I can't just use the library, but I was trying to understand it's algorithm. \n\nMy primary question is if the information mentioned in that post and in the library's documentation is out-of-date. It mentions two types of \"More\" nodes, a \"Continue This Thread\" type and a \"Load More Comments\" type. It says the former can be identified by the fact that the \"id\" field is always \"\\_\", and the way to handle it is to query /comments/{post\\_id}.json?comment={commentId}, where {commentId} is the \"parent\\_id\" field of the More object. The latter should be handled by calling /api/morechildren and passing in the values in the \"children\" array of the More object.\n\nI have yet to see an instance of the \"Continue This Thread\" type. All of the More objects I've seen have a legitimate \"id\" value. Is this something that's changed since that documentation was written, or have I just happened to pick posts that don't have that scenario? I've been working with posts with 1k-3k comments.",

(To my understanding, this is not against ToS, please correct me if I'm wrong.)\n\nI'm using macOS\n\n# Here's an overview of the steps I've followed so far:\n\n1. **Setup**:\n   * I created a Reddit app via the Reddit Developer Portal and have set up my `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri` correctly.\n   * For local testing, I'm using [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) as my redirect URI, which corresponds to my Flask server running locally.\n2. **OAuth Flow**:\n   * I initiate the authentication flow by directing users to the Reddit OAuth URL.\n   * After I authorize the app, I am redirected to my Flask server's redirect URL.\n3. **Issue**:\n   * After being redirected to my Flask server, I get the message: **\"401 Unauthorized\"** while trying to fetch the access token.\n   * The full flow is: **Redirect from Reddit > Flask server > Access token request > 401 error**\n\n# Things I’ve already checked:\n\n* I have confirmed that both the `client_id` and `client_secret` are correct.\n* The `redirect_uri` is correctly set to match what is registered on the Reddit Developer Portal.\n* The Flask server is correctly handling the redirect and listening on the proper port (`8080`).\n\nCould anyone provide advice on why I'm receiving this 401 error? Could it be an issue with the redirect flow, or is there something wrong with my OAuth setup?\n\nIf I'm missing any information that would be helpful, let me know.  \n  \nThank you in advance for any help!",

When you remove a post as a Mod, you typically want to provide a removal reason and the API allows this, but it's not documented at the time I'm writing this.  PRAW to the rescue!\n\nTo remove a post and add a reason, you'll need the Reason ID, which is in a GUID format.  To get a list of removal reasons, you'll first need to authenticate and use the \"modcontributors\" scope.  If you don't have the modcontributors scope when you get your access token, then calls to these APIs will return a 403 Forbidden.  To get the full list of scopes along with Reddit's completely inadequate description of what each is used for, hit the scopes API (no access token needed):  https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/scopes.\n\nOnce you're authenticated, then you can get the list of removal reasons by either:\n\n1.  Calling the Reddit OAuth API directly:  [https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/SUB\\_NAME/removal\\_reasons](https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/SUB_NAME/removal_reasons)\n\n\tYou'll need the Authorization and User-Agent request headers and no request body / payload\n\n2.  In PRAW, authenticate and instantiate reddit, then use:\n\n\t`for removal_reason in reddit.subreddit(\"SUB_NAME\").mod.removal_reasons:`\n\n`print(removal_reason)`\n\nThanks to Joel (LilSpazJoekp in GutHub) for helping me troubleshoot this\n\nThen, once you have the ID, you can remove posts with removal reason in PRAW or via direct API calls (Postman, etc).  Here's the complete Python code:\n\n`import praw`\n\n`refreshToken = \"YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN\" # See` [`https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html)\n\n`# Obviously, you'd want to pull these from secure storage and never put them in your code.  You can use praw.ini as well`\n\n`reddit = praw.Reddit(`  \n  `client_id=\"CLIENT_ID\", # from` [`https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps`](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)  \n  `client_secret=\"CLIENT_SECRET\",`  \n  `refresh_token=refreshToken,`  \n  `user_agent=\"YOUR_APP_NAME/1.0 by YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME\"`  \n`)`\n\n\n\n`print(\"Username: \" + str(reddit.user.me()))`  \n`print(\"Scopes: \" + str(reddit.auth.scopes())) # Must include modposts to remove and modcontributors for listing removal reasons`\n\n\n\n`subreddit = reddit.subreddit(\"YOUR_SUB_NAME\")`  \n`print(\"Subreddit Name: \" + subreddit.display_name)`\n\n\n\n`# Use this if you need to iterate over your reasons`  \n`# for removal_reason in subreddit.mod.removal_reasons:`  \n`#     print(removal_reason)  #This will be the reason ID and will look like a GUID`\n\n\n\n`reason = subreddit.mod.removal_reasons[\"YOUR_REASON_ID\"]`\n\n\n\n`submission = reddit.submission(\"YOUR_ITEM_ID\")  # Should not include the t3_`  \n`submission.mod.remove(reason_id=reason.id) # Passing in the reason ID does both actions (remove, add reason)`\n\n\n\nTo do something similar to remove a post using CURL, you would do:\n\n\\# Remove a post\n\n    curl -X POST \"https://oauth.reddit.com/api/remove\" \\\n      -H \"Authorization: bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\\n      -H \"User-Agent: YOUR_APP_NAME/1.0 by YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME\" \\\n      -d \"id=t3_POST_ID\" \\\n      -d \"spam=false\"\n\n\n\n\\# Add removal reason\n\n`curl -X POST \"https://oauth.reddit.com/api/v1/modactions/removal_reasons\" /`  \n  `-H \"Authorization: bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\`  \n  `-H \"User-Agent: YOUR_APP_NAME/1.0 by YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME\" \\`  \n  `-d \"api_type=json\" \\`  \n  `-d 'json={\"item_ids\": [\"t3_POST_ID\"], \"mod_note\": \"\", \"reason_id\": \"YOUR_REASON_ID\"}'`\n\n\n\nAlso note that the PRAW code has an endpoint defined for \"api/v1/modactions/removal\\_link\\_message\" but it's not used in this process ... and not documented.  I'm not a violent person, but in order to stay that way, I hope I never meet the person in charge of Reddit's API documentation.",

The results for the search in the subreddit didn't match up with the ones that PRAW gave me (retaining the default sort and time filter). \n\nI know that PRAW passes the query through Reddit's API so I'm unclear as to whether the entire search term also gets cut off like when I manually entered it?

If so, what kind of stemming does it apply?\n\n2. **Boolean query syntax rules** – I’ve noticed cases where retrieved posts don’t fully match my boolean query. Are there any known quirks or limitations?\n\n3. **Query term limits** – I’ve found inconsistencies in how many terms a query can handle before breaking or behaving unexpectedly. Does anyone know the exact rules?\n\n\n\nAny insights, experiences, or documentation links would be greatly appreciated!",

I did it this way because the first step is to lock the post and if even more reports accumulate it removes it. A simple check for having visited the post wasn't enough.*\n\nThere's `submission.mark_visited()` but that's a premium-only feature and I don't have premium. Looking for a clever alternative for that.\n\nI'm constructing a mod bot that would like to lock submissions if some criteria are met. One of them is the number of reports but there are others like score, upvote ratio and number of comments... This check cannot be performed by AutoMod.\n\nIt monitors the `subreddit(SUB_NAME).mod.stream.reports(only=\"submissions\")` stream and whenever a report comes in it checks the submission's report count from `submission(ID_HERE).user_reports` and adds the dismissed reports to that as well from `submission(ID_HERE).user_reports_dismissed` (and some other attributes) and if the criteria are met it locks the submission.\n\n**Problem: if I now manually decide the submission is ok and unlock it the bot will attempt to lock it again if a report comes in.**\n\nAny ideas on which submission attributes I could use to mark the submission as \"visited\" so that the bot no longer takes action on it? I'd rather not dive into databases and storing the ID there for this one if at all possible.\n\nI thought of changing the flair or leaving a comment but those are visible to the members of the sub... I also thought of having the bot report it with a custom report reason that it could look at at a later time but that seems a little clunky, too.\n\nI saw an attribute called `'mod_note': None` \\- what is that and can I use to it flag the submission as visited somehow by leaving a note to the ...submission?

A domain/keyword to ban, an improvement to the bot, or anything? Just leave a comment below or PM me [(click HERE to PM me)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=firemylasers)!**\n\nOkay, time for a little update. I'm not that interested in this project these days, and I'm too busy with university to care about tech news. I have done nothing to the bot in quite some time beyond a minor filter list update. For the time being, this will probably continue. (The source code is also a bit hard to understand at this point, it's not the most elegantly written bot and I threw together features and patches a bit haphazardly). If you have a proposed feature addition, have noticed a problem (such as the bot stopping posting), or want me to blacklist another keyword/domain, please PM me. I'll keep this bot/subreddit active indefinitely, the VPS it's on is needed for other stuff and the bot is completely automatic (it also hasn't broken in quite some time), but I won't be actively improving it. I'm not sure how many people actually find this to be a useful alternative to /r/technology, but based on voting patterns, traffic, and subreddit subscriptions, it does seem that there are at least some people out there who find it useful, so I won't be shutting this down or anything. Just be aware that I am not currently working on this project and if there's an issue you will need to bring it to my attention for it to get fixed.\n\nAnother little update (2/5/2015): I'm even more busy with university these days. I've updated the submission stats below (close to 72k URLs submitted in the past year and a half!). The bot seems to be running fine with zero monitoring, and subreddit traffic has held fairly steady every month since the last big drop around July 2014. The log file is a bit massive, but I've got plenty of spare disk space. I still have no plans to update the bot, and while I'm not quite happy with the current filters, I don't think there are any obvious improvements that I could make. The traffic counts seem to indicate that this subreddit is still useful, which is excellent. If anyone has any ideas for keywords to block/restrict (or domains), feel free to PM me.\n\n##News\n\n[News prior to 4/29/14 can be found in the old version of this thread (click here to view it).](http://www.reddit.com/r/realtech/comments/1kjduq/subreddit_news_proposed_domainkeyword_bans/)\n\n* On July 29th, the bot was down for around eight hours due to what seems to be an unannounced change in reddit's API. I didn't notice the issue until the bot had been down for six hours, and it took me quite a while to figure out exactly what the issue was and how to fix it. Anyways, the bot is back up now, sorry about that.\n\n* It looks like the content in both /r/technology and /r/realtech has been going downhill recently. I've tweaked the filters a bit, which should hopefully improve things.\n\n##Rough development ideas\n\n* Tweak the flood limit to eliminate post flooding after bot downtime.\n\n* Consider a tag system. I could either tag with the original usernames, or with a bot-guessed topic.\n\n##Stats\n\n*Last updated 04/09/15*\n\nTotal unique URLs submitted: 80743\n\nTop 20 domains (with submission counts):\n\n    2850 arstechnica.com\n    2805 www.theverge.com\n    2479 techcrunch.com\n    1778 www.engadget.com\n    1675 www.wired.com\n    1293 www.theguardian.com\n    1212 www.nytimes.com\n    1153 www.bbc.co.uk\n    1140 www.businessinsider.com\n     963 mashable.com\n     898 www.washingtonpost.com\n     858 www.reuters.com\n     817 www.cnet.com\n     816 www.zdnet.com\n     795 www.forbes.com\n     759 gigaom.com\n     703 www.bbc.com\n     703 phys.org\n     700 thenextweb.com\n     633 www.techdirt.com\n\n\n##Information\n\nAladdin was written in Ruby.
