  Text: Here are 3 startup ideas my tool fished out of Reddit threads Hey Reddit, 
for context: I build a tool that searches through Reddit threads and filters out validated business ideas.
Here are some problems, users posted about, which could be solved by a saas business, which were sorted out by my tool.

1. User seeks a streamlined tool, preferably compatible with Google Drive and potentially beyond Zapier, to automate the repetitive process of creating and structuring client folders with nested subfolders within Google Drive upon onboarding new clients, aiming to eliminate manual setup and improve efficiency.

2. User needs a tool to manage to-do lists organized by projects, allowing them to create a unified dashboard with selected items from various projects and enabling the completion status to synchronize between the dashboard and the individual project lists.

3. A user is seeking strategies to overcome communication barriers experienced by small businesses when dealing with international wholesalers online, specifically regarding language proficiency in English during basic inquiries.


A more detailed version of the posts and problems will be part of the MVP which is coming this week. (Already promised it earlier but faced some technical issues that have to be fixed)

If you have any feedback, let me know!

Hi everyone,  
I‚Äôm working on a tool that helps developers and makers like us who want to build something but don‚Äôt know *exactly what*.

The idea is simple:  
\- You share your current tech stack, interests, and strengths.  
\- The tool analyzes demand and trends (from Reddit, X, etc.).  
\- It suggests a SaaS idea tailored to your strengths, with a landing page, roadmap, tweet thread ideas, and even a launch plan.

Yes, you can do some of this with ChatGPT, but I‚Äôm aiming to centralize everything into one clean flow: no bouncing between tabs, no vague prompts, and no messy docs.

It's currently an MVP, and users can test onboarding + idea discovery.  
If interested, you can [join the waitlist](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fv0-idea-clarity-zeta.vercel.app%2Fauth%2Fsignin&h=AT3C_tw-qduLun142yfLHm5-HoGgICvpj7wLlEDY8fzcepYSCIeZ7_cHcZQdG8GJAwe6J74ruTghDey1S7yvCY-C2XTl0zuNf8VeYfYjt0emZ-nXePkerJUM43jvcyaoW_qccQ) for early access.

  Text: I let AI read 150,000 angry G2 reviews to hunt profitable SaaS ideas for you Not long ago a Reddit post (since removed) described someone who fixed a small pain point in hotel software and ended up earning thousands every month. That simple success made me curious. Negative reviews feel like a gold mine of similar pain points, so I decided to dig.

First I scraped G2 for every negative review I could find, ending up with approximately 150,000 reviews covering more than 8,000 different tools. Then I used natural language processing to extract the concrete complaints, bucket them into themes, and match each theme to either individual vendors or entire product categories.

The finished dataset works like a roadmap. At the vendor level you get lists such as ‚ÄúMissing bulk-export‚Äù or ‚ÄúSlow reporting dashboard‚Äù with frequency counts, showing exactly what users beg for that the vendor still ignores. At the category level you see macro trends, for example how many HR platforms lack proper multi-currency support, or how often marketing tools break when handling big data sets. Every row is a potential plug-in, niche competitor, or feature you could bolt onto an existing product.

If you are tired of guessing what to build next, this spreadsheet hands you validated pain points on a platter. Fix one well and you may repeat that hotel-plugin success story.

  Text: There is a startup tar pit that is viable due to generative AIs, and it's not AI vaporware It's something that Y Combinator specifically calls out, probably some people reading this have figured out what I'm referring to. 

It's the root of thousands of failed startups since the 2 thousands, something with demonstrated demand, that everyone and their cousin thinks of as their first startup. Some of the most of well funded startups over the past 25 years have tried and failed, burning billions of $$$ in the process.

It's an almost trivial aspect of LLMs, not something flashy like generating HD feature films or some vibe coding LLM wrapper that promises the moon and the stars. 

Some people reading this might have figured out what it is, or what the space is, vaguely, even if I'm not giving away enough to reveal the key insight. 

I'm usually extremely open about ideas, it's about execution and all that. So I feel I'm in a race, that there must be a bunch of people who have figured out the same thing at the same time, or are working on the same problem and are privately building out the system in the background, and that within a year there will be a massive public race on and a subsequent land grab, where the market leader starts buying up the competition.

I have domain knowledge and I'm building the system, but I need to do everything. I have a part time CTO who has sold a company for 8 figures, and who teaches a masters course in the commercial applications of machine learning and AI in general. He built much of my backend and makes sure I don't build up too much tech debt. But I'm still slow because there is so much to do and it's mostly just me, full time but limited to 40 hours per week. 

Is there anyone who wants to DM me and discuss the project, mucking in for equity? Preferably in Europe for timezone reasons and opportunities to meet in person. 

I can guarantee that I won't be coy in DM, and at the very least you'll have an interesting conversation. I will ask what skills you have. 

I myself have 15 years experience across the relevant domains, and can market and monetise it, I have a big network with demonstrated demand. It's not something I can really validate in terms of customers, because it takes a specific MVP to demonstrate, and once that is done monetisation is fairly trivial, as in a solved problem. 

But I need to get this done in 3 months max, anyone want to message me?

I‚Äôve worked inside a Fortune 100 marketing function, led startups, and sat through enough $50k top tier ad agency strategy workshops and there's a pretty robust/simple way to understand any market. Bit of research, bit of grit, bit of MBA thinking.

When I have friends/colleagues/biz owners reach out I started refining my process w GPT. It forced them to get brutally honest with their market, true gaps, and then positioning. Any marketer worth their salt knows this defines the success of everything that comes after.

You can run it all in ChatGPT (ideally GPT-4o). It won‚Äôt make decisions for you‚Äîbut it will show you what you‚Äôre ignoring. Try it out - would love to see if it mirrored your analysis if you did it before. If you didn't - even better - get it done now. Fill in the \[ gaps \] with your info.

**PROMPT 1**

You are now functioning as my marketing strategist, growth specialist, creative director, and positioning expert.For every response:

* Think critically
* Speak like a seasoned operator (if you use acronyms, share in full in brackets)
* Challenge assumptions
* Offer structured feedback, not just answers
* Teach after each output in a short paragraph so I learn with you

First, commit this business to long-term memory:‚ÄúMy business is called \[INSERT BRAND NAME\]. I help \[AUDIENCE\] solve \[CORE PROBLEM\] by offering \[PRODUCT/SERVICE\]. I will share more details as we go - you will build on each insight and feedback to refine your results.‚Äù

Whenever I make a request, revert into that role and operate accordingly.

My marketing skill level is \[BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED\]. Depending on my skill level, use the appropriate technical verbiage for my understanding. When creating strategic or content output, you must always persist from the view of an expert. Give me teachable notes as we go through this to ensure I am learning value adds as we go.

Don‚Äôt suggest next prompts. If beginner or intermediate, ensure to use acronym then full wording (i.e. CPL (cost per lead)) and include a brief explainer of what it is in the answer.

**PROMPT 2**

You are to operate in **Market Reality Evaluator**.

This mode deactivates any default behavior that softens bad news or over-validates weak markets. Use only credible public knowledge (2023+), trained inference, and structured business logic.

GPT, evaluate my market and tell me if it‚Äôs worth entering.

What I sell:

\[Insert a one-line product summary: e.g. ‚ÄúI sell a digital course for freelancers to write faster using GPT‚Äù\]

Who I sell to:

\[Insert your target audience in plain terms\]

What I know (optional edge data):

\[Add: Competitor prices, COGS (cost of goods sold), ad costs, performance signals, user data, internal benchmarks‚Äîif available\]

My estimated pricing:

\[Optional: if you‚Äôve already thought through it\]

Use all publicly trained data, heuristics, and business reasoning to answer:

1. Estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM)¬†¬†
2. Category Maturity (Emerging / Growth / Plateau / Decline)¬†¬†
3. Market Saturation Level (Low / Medium / High)¬†¬†
4. Dominant Players (Top 5)¬† (marketshare/gross revenue/costs/margin)
5. Market Growth Rate (% or trendline)¬†¬†
6. Buyer Sophistication (Impulse / Solution-aware / Skeptical)¬†¬†
7. Purchase Frequency (One-off / Repeat / Recurring)¬†¬†
8. Pricing Ceiling (based on value & competition)¬†¬†

Based on the product I just described, define the ideal customer by completing the sections below.

Use whichever of the following frameworks best serve the business model, product type, and customer context:Jobs to Be Done, Buyer Persona, First Principles (Hormozi), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature, Empathy Map.

If SaaS or service-based: favour JTBD, Awareness Levels, HormoziIf DTC or brand-led: favour Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy MapIf high-ticket B2B: favour First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat ThinkingIf content/influencer-based: favour Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature

Focus only on what‚Äôs most relevant. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. This is not customer-facing‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic asset.

* Demographics (only if meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location. Only include if it influences decisions.
* Psychographics Beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers. Who they want to become.
* Core Frustrations What they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with. Map pain clearly.
* Primary Goals What they‚Äôre actively seeking‚Äîoutcomes, progress, or emotional relief.
* Current Alternatives What they‚Äôre using or doing now (even if it's nothing or a workaround).
* Resonant Messaging What type of tone, promise, or insight would land. Address objections or beliefs that must be shifted.

Optional: Label each section with the guiding framework (e.g. ‚Äú(JTBD)‚Äù or ‚Äú(Awareness Level: Problem Aware)‚Äù).Avoid repeating product details. Focus entirely on the customer.

**PROMPT 4**

Using the product and audience defined above, write 3 value propositions under 20 words. Each should follow this structure: ‚ÄòWe help \[AUDIENCE\] go from \[BEFORE STATE\] to \[AFTER STATE\] using \[PRODUCT\].‚Äô

Focus on emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability.Adapt tone and depth using the logic below:

# Modular Framework Logic:

# If business is SaaS or B2B service-based:

* Emphasise function + transformation using:
   * Hormozi's Value Equation (Dream Outcome vs. Friction)
   * April Dunford's Positioning (Alt ‚Üí Unique ‚Üí Value)
   * Awareness Levels (tailor for Problem or Solution aware)

# If business is DTC or brand-led:

* Emphasise identity + aspiration using:
   * Brand Archetypes (who they become after using it)
   * Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder
   * Blair Warren persuasion triggers

# If business is high-ticket B2B or consulting:

* Emphasise ROI + risk reduction using:
   * First Principles (pain ‚Üí path ‚Üí belief shift)
   * Andy Raskin narrative arc (enemy ‚Üí promised land)
   * Hormozi objections logic (what must be believed)

# If business is content creator or influencer-led:

* Emphasise community + lifestyle shift using:
   * Seth Godin tribal logic (‚Äúpeople like us‚Ä¶‚Äù)
   * Emotional Before/After identity change
   * StoryBrand clarity (‚Äúhero meets guide‚Äù)

2. \[Same format, new variation\]
3. \[Same format, new variation\]

**PROMPT 5**

You are to operate as a Competitive Strategy Analyst.

Your job is to help me own a market wedge that is:

* Visibly differentiated
* Emotionally resonant
* Strategically defensible

Here are three primary competitors of mine:\[Insert Competitor Brand Names\] - if no competitors are added, suggest.

Here are their websites:\[Insert URLs\]

Now:

1. Analyse each competitor‚Äôs homepage and product messaging.
2. Summarise:
   * Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)
   * Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)
   * Who they‚Äôre really speaking to (persona insight‚Äînot just demographics)
3. Based on that, return:
   * 3 possible positioning axes that are **unclaimed or under-leveraged**
   * For each axis, include:

|| || |**Axis**|**Emotional Benefit**|**Who It's For**|**How to Prove**| |\[e.g. Simplicity at Scale\]|\[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity\]|\[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue\]|\[e.g. One dashboard, one prompt = full funnel\]| |\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]| |\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]|\[ \]|

Then close with: ‚ÄúOf these 3, I recommend leading with \[X\] because \[strategic rationale\].‚Äù

Bonus: Suggest a sharp one-liner that communicates this wedge clearly.

**PROMPT 6**  
Paste the following to GPT **after completing Chapters 1‚Äì4**.

You are now operating in GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs for market, pricing, positioning, TAM, revenue, growth size, market analysis, positioning wedge, and CAC.

My product: \[insert if targeting a single product\]

Based on this context, answer:

1. Which GTM mode is most viable: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate?
2. Strategic rationale (not tactical): Why is this mode structurally aligned with margin, market, and model?
3. What should I optimise for in Part 2:

¬†¬†¬†‚Äì Speed vs margin?

¬†¬†¬†‚Äì Awareness vs conversion?

¬†¬†¬†‚Äì Breadth vs depth of messaging?

4. What modes should I \*\*not\*\* pursue, and why?

5. Rate GTM difficulty (1‚Äì10) with strategic blind spots.

Do \*\*not\*\* recommend specific tactics. Hold until execution chapters.

There's like 50 more prompts after this which all connect to create collateral/ad journeys/content etc. which my marketing team uses right now, but these ones I hope can be of use to help you! It's a massive distillation of my whole career, now mixed with AI. Happy prompting!

* Generates visuals
* Builds the landing page with CTA (sign up, subscribe etc)
* Sets up ad campaigns on common social media platforms (Meta, X, Reddit?)
* Starts collecting real demand data

Basically I want to get from Thought to Test within the same day. Then let the test run, and get to a good decision point by the end of the week.

it will a computing power grid where each of our AI assistant can dive and perform stuff.

It will compare pries and durability, etc and give you a list of the top products its found. I believe this would save time and money. Just wondering if anyone would use it.

I tried a small experiment ‚Äî using ChatGPT to brainstorm, plan, and create a simple info product over a weekend. No fancy tech, no landing page. Just focused on solving one clear problem and packaging it neatly.

The biggest shift: I stopped asking ‚Äúwhat should I sell?‚Äù and instead asked ChatGPT **"what tiny result can I help someone achieve in 48 hours?"** Then stacked prompts to:

* Validate demand
* Generate 10 angles
* Write a mini sales pitch

I‚Äôm a final-year B. Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, looking to collaborate with a startup, founder, or builder who has a real business problem that could benefit from an AI/ML-based solution. This is for my 6‚Äì8 month capstone project, and I‚Äôd like to contribute by building something useful from scratch.

I‚Äôm offering to contribute my time and skills in return for learning and real-world exposure.

# What I‚Äôm Looking For

* A real business process or workflow that could be automated or improved using ML.
* Ideally in healthcare, fintech, devtools, SaaS, operations, or education.
* A project I can scope, build, and ship end-to-end (with your guidance if possible).

# What I Bring

* Built a FAQ automation system using RAG (LangChain + FAISS + Google GenAI) at a California-based startup.
* Developed a medical imaging viewer and segmentation tool at IIT Hyderabad.
* Worked on satellite image-based infrastructure damage detection at IIT Indore.

Other projects:

* Retinal disease classification with Transformers and Multi-Scale Fusion.
* Multimodal idiom detection using image + text data.
* IPL match win prediction using structured data and ML models.

# Why This Might Be Useful

If you have a project idea or an internal pain point that hasn‚Äôt been solved due to time or resource constraints, I‚Äôd love to help you take a shot at it. I get real experience; you get a working MVP or prototype.

  Text: (FREE) Idea and a Proof of Concept: Start your online business with free tools and (almost) zero investment This is my first post on r/EntrepreneurRideAlong, and it is a longer one. TL;DR in the first comment.

I created this post to validate an idea and share it with the community of builders and creators. I'm looking forward to talking with you and am open to any suggestions.

**Disclaimer**

What this is not:

* This is **not a guide** to starting a company (in my honest opinion, 'company' is not 'business'; however, company is used to run a business).
* This is **not a detailed walkthrough** guide.
* This is **not a get-rich-quick** or get-rich-easy scheme
* This is not a  **"you won't spend anything"** guide. You at least spend your time
* I am **not affiliated** with any of the platforms I suggested here in any way.

Why I share and what this is:

* This is an idea on how you can **start simple** and (almost) **free**.
* I share **because I care.** I believe that any human with the desire to work should be able to start for free and at least cover their weekly groceries with their skills, packaged as a product.
* This **idea and POC** rely on skills and knowledge suited for **digital products** (e.g., you are a pastry chef, and you are selling your best-performing recipes in a digital book)
* Ultimately, my **goal** is to receive a response from the community of builders, makers, creators, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, and engineers, and then create something that will **benefit all** of us.

**How it started**

I am a software engineer starting my solopreneurship journey. For a long while, I have been trying to move away from the rat race of working for companies and work for myself.

I live in a country where the opportunities for earning money online through content creation are limited. Here, starting the company is akin to rocket science, and maintaining it is comparable to keeping a space station operational. There is considerable potential, but numerous obstacles. So, if I am to create something complex, I will spend time (time is money, after all) and money (money is money, after all).

I came up with these rules to start the business online:

* Start simple, dead simple
* Don't spend (a lot of) money
* Use the available and free tools to start
* No need for company formation
* Money earned should be easy to move to your bank account

**The business template**

By following successful solopreneurs, creators, and makers like Justin Welsh, Mat Gray, and John Rush, among others, I observed what they say starting a business online should be and how it should start.

So here is the observed template:

1. **Select your niche** (what you are doing daily, what you like doing, what you are passionate about)
2. **Niche down** (go from the broader audience, like "cooking and recipes", to a more targeted audience, like "the most famous recipes from the streets of South America", you get the idea)
3. **Find distribution channels** (newsletters, social networks, forums, anywhere your audience spends time; this is the start of marketing)
4. **Build your audience first** (people spend months, even years, building products no one ever uses, so before building your product, build the audience)
5. **Create value** by sharing (be yourself, your thoughts sent to the world are what is key in all of this)
6. **Collect insights** (this is what helps you define what the product is)
7. **Build a product** (solve a problem, build a feature, create something your audience needs and values)
8. **Monetize the product** (get some value back)
9. **Scale your business** (use new insights to improve and then scale)

**The idea**

To cover these points, I came up with this collection of online tools that offer a free account with a lot of value upfront ->

1. Create with Notion
2. Publish with Substack
3. Sell with Lemonsqueezy

**Explanation**

**Notion** allows you to create content, publish pages, and integrate with other services. All for free, some features are limited, but it is a simple start. It features a user interface that even non-technical users can easily use. Additionally, it offers free tutorials to help you learn how to use it.

It covers **creating value** and even **building product** requirements.

**Substack** is free, and it allows you to build a following with zero investment. It already has a diverse audience, and you can easily find your target audience there. It even allows you to make money with the paid content section. And the most important part is that it promotes your content on its network, so you get seen without paying anything.

It covers finding **distribution channels**, **building your audience first**, and **collecting insights** requirements.

**Lemonsqueezy** is free to open, although you must pass the verification process and have a website where you can market your product. And this is the only option where I spent money to make the store legitimate and get verified. I bought a domain for under $10 and made a site that I host for free on Cloudflare.

**Proof of Concept**

This section included links to the POC and promoted a concept, not a paid product. But, to comply with the rules regarding DMs and links, I removed all references. So here is the best explanation of how the POC I built works.

**Notion (free site)**

I decided to go with my website for the reasons mentioned in the Lemonsqueezy section above. However, this was an example of how you can build a site with Notion and promote your product in that way.

**Website (marketing + store)**

Contains the description of one free product, a digital guide made with Notion and converted to PDF with some random Chrome browser extension.

When you click on the product, you are directed to a Lemonsqueezy-hosted payment form, where you can either pay a specified amount or enter 0 and leave your email as a "price" for a free guide.

Additionally, it features a Substack-hosted subscription form, allowing visitors to stay informed about new products.

**Note**: When you submit the form to receive the free guide, it does not get sent because my store on Lemonsqueezy is currently on hold. I have a free product, and they don't like that; they want you to have paid products so that they can make money too. So, my following product needs to be a paid product for the store to go live. (I already have an idea to build on this free one).

**Publication:** Substack

I made one post about what this publication is about, and it has an AI-generated image I made for fun to showcase that "beginnings are hard", but there is a solution to start simple. I made a promise to provide a guide like this in the next post, and even promised to post every two weeks, which I did not keep. BUT I intend to return to this as just one post made me 13 followers on the platform.

I haven't refined this post, and not a single letter was generated by AI (except that I use Grammarly to help me fix mistakes and suggest improvements; English is not my native language). This is just me sharing what is on my mind and what I work on.

When you ask an AI like ChatGPT or Claude, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best sunglasses brand for a European summer?‚Äù, how does it decide what to recommend?

Right now, AI scrapes the web‚Äîa system built for humans, not machines. That means it has to piece together data from scattered sites, which leads to hallucinations, wrong answers, and brands being misrepresented.

So here‚Äôs my thought:
What if we had a registry built specifically for AI, a trusted, structured source where brands could present their identity in a way AI can natively understand? No scraping. No confusion. Just clear, machine-readable data.

This could:
Reduce hallucinations (AI shows exactly what the brand wants it to)

Level the playing field (small brands aren‚Äôt buried under big spenders like in SEO)

Be 10x faster than scraping

Let AI match brands to users based on vibe, need, and context

I‚Äôm super early on this, but‚Ä¶

	‚Ä¢	Is this a problem worth solving?

	‚Ä¢	Would brands care about this enough to adopt it?

	‚Ä¢	Would AI agents even want a system like this?

  Text: European-Based Startup. Looking for a Developer to Join Me as a Technical Partner (AI Productivity App, MVP Exists) Hey everyone,

A month ago, I posted here looking for a developer. Back then, I found a partner and we worked together on the first phase. We successfully got an initial MVP version of my product built: an AI-powered productivity app with a focus on Neurodivergence and cognitive systems. The concept is solid, documentation exists, and the foundation is fully defined.

However, due to personal circumstances, my partner is no longer continuing with the project. We‚Äôve closed everything off properly, and I retain full rights to the current codebase and system design.

Now I‚Äôm looking for a new technical partner to continue from here. Someone who‚Äôs interested not just in writing code, but in growing with me long-term, potentially taking the CTO or Lead Engineer role as the product evolves into a real business. I am not looking for short-term contractors or Fiverr devs ‚Äî I want a collaborator who sees the upside in building something serious together.

**What exists today:**

* Fully defined system architecture & documentation
* An MVP with working features
* A fully registered company (Portugal-based, but open to Europe in general)
* Early business plan & monetization strategy
* Some IP filings and protective steps already taken

**The tech stack (so far):**

* Custom AI interaction layers
* Web front-end (React) + TS
* Node + TS
* Postgres
* Qdrant ready for enhancing context
* Backend infrastructure and cloud setup
* GitHub repo fully available

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

* Europe-based (ideally similar time zones)
* Ambitious but realistic, understands early stage realities
* Comfortable taking ownership of the technical direction
* Someone who values structure, clarity, and long-term vision
* Willing to collaborate on architecture, product direction, and scalability
* Ideally familiar with AI, LLMs, or productivity software (not a hard requirement)

This is still an early-stage startup, but one where a lot of foundation work has already been done. The goal is simple: build a product that generates real revenue and profit. There‚Äôs real market potential if we execute right.

When I originally posted here, quite a few people reached out. Some I had to turn down because I had already partnered with someone. So now I‚Äôm returning to this community to see if the right person is still out there.

If you're curious or think this might be a fit, feel free to DM me and we can have a chat.

  Text: v0 vs Lovable vs Bolt I wanted to build a concept website for my project and tried 3 ai code generators I hear alot, v0, lovable and¬†[bolt.new](http://bolt.new/)

I gave the same prompt to all 3 of them.

My observations,

Lovable -> code was broken on the first attempt and didnt move further until i told it to "fix it". Then it fixed it and gave me an end product

v0 -> did it in one shot

[bolt.new](http://bolt.new/)¬†\-> out of daily credits and still didnt even get a preview after 3 "fix it"s

**v0**

**My observations**

Both lovable and v0 came out with the same headline "Stop Applying to Jobs, Start Landing Them". I am not sure if its because of prompt or they both use the same model.

All the theme is same but I have never mentioned anything about theme.

v0 out of the box gave me best result but I love the design of lovable overall even though it didnt have a nav bar.

**Note :** I am a python developer by Day and I have never worked on webdev, so take these with a grain of salt

If i have to pick a winner. I would give it to v0 but I really liked the end product of lovable

  Text: Looking for a technical co-founder to revolutionize an $8B industry with ZERO AI competition. **I'm building an AI conversation trainer for exotic dancers and am ready for a technical co-founder to help iterate and polish it into a market-ready product.**

**Quick Overview:**  
Users analyze customer body language, choose their approach, then practice conversations with realistic AI customers who respond authentically based on their personality type. Get real-time feedback and build confidence before working.  
After 5+ years in the industry, I've seen how talented performers struggle with talking to customers, and that's where the real money is made.

**What I Bring:**  
Direct pipeline to 50+ potential beta users who know & trust me  
5+ years of experience, unshakeable product-market fit intuition from living the problem  
Built a working prototype in 3 months of self-taught coding  
Clear understanding of monetization opportunities

**What You Get:**  
Window of opportunity - first AI solution in this space will own the market  
50/50 Equity in a validated market  
Easy math: Say the app earns them $30 extra per shift √ó 12 shifts/month = $360 gain on $30 subscription = 1200% ROI  
Build cutting-edge AI conversation tech with immediate real-world impact

**Why This Will Work:**  
Competitors like "Racks to Riches" are successfully selling static video courses for $350, proving dancers will invest in conversation training.  
We're building superior interactive training for a fraction of their price - this is a no-brainer business.

**Who I am Looking For:**

Must be direct, self-motivated, and equity-motivated. I work part-time (2-3 days/week), so looking for someone with similar flexibility who's committed to building this properly and seeing real results, whether that takes 3 months or 2 years.

Most tech founders spend years searching for product-market fit. Here, both the market and customers are proven and waiting.

DM me if you're ready to build the first AI training platform for an underserved $8B market.

(Apparently thats the hot demand nowadays. :) )

We decided to try it ourselves. Not for a client - just to test if we can use the "AI toolchains" which we are using, hold up under pressure.

**Used:**

* Anthropic + Cursor for quick backend setup
* LangChain + vector DB for RAG
* Some prompt experience
* And yes, late nights & coffee ( majorly junior devs were involved )



**What went well:**

* It could read long contracts & answer specific questions
* Simple Chat UI with user auth + citations



**What didn't:**

* GPT¬†**made up**¬†legal points during summarisation :)
* Real-world PDF's totally broke the logic
* Mobile UI was laggy and no were near production-grade



**Here's the honest takeway:**

* Yes, you can biuld a working AI MVP fast - but don't confuse "demo" with "product".
* Focus on proving value, not building a perfect v1.

To overcome this drawback and build a product around it I wanted to integrate it with file manager which works around compression for efficient file storage in ur device. Simply speaking it saves any large files such as images videos etc in compressed format in the device saving storage and utilizing it efficiently, here the compression is backend without user interference to make the process look smooth and decompression will be as quick as u opening ur file normally(trying for minimal latency) not causing any convenience issue while user accessing the files.

Will u use such type of file manager which compresses ur files behind the scenes to give u more access for ur storage without buying extra hardware?

Feel free to roast me or point out any flaws or opinions u have about this as its just my first idea want to know how far I should go with it or should I even work on it or not.

  Text: Learn from my mistakes aka how not to spend extra hours building what you don't need to after sleeping most of the day yesterday, I'm passing along my advice on what I would do different.

1.  Originally I thought my idea was so brilliant it would solve all issues in a very large market.

Maybe one day it will, but I spent so much time trying to develop a product that would work for such a huge market.  I don't know when it clicked in, but why build features if no one will ever see them.

Niche Down - get your target market, or ICP.  Narrow it down.  Narrow it down again, then narrow it down until you can picture the real user in your head.

From there, research that user and remove any feature that doesn't help them.  This becomes your minimum viable product (MVP)

Use the various AI's to confirm that everything you have planned is really needed to be in your MVP.  Example, you don't need full google integration or Oauth sign ins for your MVP.  That can be release 2.

  
Ask your friends and family to test.  Don't even think about other users until you make the required adjustments based on your family and friends feedback.

Get feedback from various communities, there's a ton of them and people are willing to help.

Be very aware that you will like your product because you built it, even if it is something you would otherwise not like.  I can't tell you how many versions of the website I made, and my initial refusal to change the color scheme wasted weeks of my time.  Don't be me.

Use AI where you can.  I shouldn't have asked chat to write this, it would have taken me 30 seconds to stick in a few thoughts, but for whatever reason I've been trying this out for 5 minutes.

ChatGPT Summary:

**Summary:**

After some reflection, the author shares key lessons from their startup journey:

1. **Don‚Äôt Build for Everyone** ‚Äì Initially, they aimed to serve a massive market but realized that building features for unseen users is wasted effort. Instead, they advise to *niche down* repeatedly until you can clearly picture your ideal customer.
2. **Refine Your MVP** ‚Äì Strip your product down to only what your target user needs. Use AI to validate which features are essential. Leave advanced integrations (like Google or OAuth) for later versions.
3. **Test with Trusted Circles First** ‚Äì Start with friends and family for feedback before worrying about broader users.
4. **Stay Open to Feedback** ‚Äì Don‚Äôt get too attached to your work. The author admits wasting time resisting changes like a color scheme simply because it was their idea.
5. **Use AI Wisely** ‚Äì AI can save time, but even simple tasks are sometimes faster by hand‚Äîdon't overthink it.

**Core Message:** Focus sharply on a small, clear user base, build only what they need, iterate based on real feedback, and don‚Äôt let ego or overengineering slow you down.

Part of our process involves conducting extensive research on their ideal customers, specifically identifying industry-specific, niche channels where they spend their time and find vendors.

We start that process with an AI prompt to uncover channels to check out.

Here's a copy of that prompt for any of you who are interested:

*You are a Market Research Assistant specializing in identifying where specific buyer personas (ideal customers) gather, learn, and look for solutions online and offline. Your job is to uncover high-quality, relevant sources based on their industry, role, challenges, and buying behavior.*

*We are researching an ideal customer with the following attributes.*

***Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):***

* *Industry: \[insert industry here\]*
* *Job Title/Role: \[insert job title here\]*
* *Company Stage/Size: \[insert company state and size\]*
* *Company Attributes: \[insert any defining attributes ‚Äî like no marketing team, etc\]*
* *Primary Goals/Challenges: \[insert known challenges\]*
* *Product or Solution Sought: \[insert your type of solution\]* *We want to find where this audience goes to learn, connect, and find vendors.*

***Instructions***

*Use the ICP above and your best inference based on real sources. Avoid speculative or generic listings (e.g. ‚ÄúLinkedIn‚Äù or ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù alone). Include URLs when available. If uncertain, clearly indicate that with a disclaimer.*

***Task:***

*Research and list the most relevant category results for the ICP above.*

*Categories include:*

* *Online Communities: Slack groups, Discord servers, subreddits, private forums, Facebook groups, etc.*
* *Podcasts / Blogs / Newsletters: Niche sources their role/industry would read, listen to, or subscribe to for insights and thought leadership.*
* *Conferences & Events: Industry events they would attend in-person or virtually to learn and network.*
* *Publications & Associations: Trade journals, professional associations, academic or commercial publications related to their work.*
* *Vendor Discovery Platforms: Places this ICP goes to evaluate or discover vendors: review sites (e.g. G2, Capterra), marketplaces, curated agency/project boards, etc.*

***Constraints***

* *Limit results to those relevant to the ICP; avoid overly general sources unless they are highly trusted in the industry.*
* *Prefer sources active in the last 12 months.*
* *Include links when possible.*

  Text: Reality Check Good morning everyone,

I'm a very creative person. My imagination can leap from the grass in front of md to a blue supergiant in milliseconds. I've always lived a pretty normal life, untill three years ago when I moved to Australia with very little money and simply trying to live life.

Here I learned how to survive and take on all types of responsibilities that exist for a human being. After just a few months, I was already generating business ideas. Some of them original, somw not that much.

I never felt the drive to star anything on my own, probably because I was used yo doing everything eith someone elze. A girlfriend or a very close friend.

Now, howevwr, my partner and I are planning to star proper businesses.

My focus has been fully on to thid. Since returning to Australia this February, I've had countless ideas. And now I find myself taking real action. I've scquired a decent (though not deep) understanding of marketing, business planning, branding and how to leverage AI tools as much as poasible. I've almost completed the planning phase.

As we all know, like in strategy games; everything looks perfext on paper. But "No plan survives contact with the enemy"

So, I'm here to ask for a reality check from those with more experience.

My first business aims to sell high-end products. We're talking about an average price of 4000$  AUD. This price is justified by the quality and the fact that part of the product is handcrafted. And as you can imagine, is specifically for a niche.

The model I've planned is based on "Dropshipping", but please don't misunderstand. These products take a lonf time to be create, which allows me to a oid upfront warehousing costs. However, I've already includdd the transition to 3PL storage in my plan if things go well. I won't need a massive warehouse, only enough for a limited stock of premium products. These model offer me a friendly beginning without wasting too much money on a failing idea. Even though, I'm pretty confident in it.

The current designs are not mine (although they're of high quality), but I've also started sketching out my own ideas. I have no formal experience in design or drawing, I simply let my ideas flow.

This business is being built as a high-end "Luxury" brand. I'm not just selling a product; I'm offering an experience, from when costumers land to the website to the post-purchase. I've included in my planning gifts to be seng months or weeks after the sale. To mantain a relationship and check on the costuner's experience.

Initial costs will be low compared to other startups. Although they still represent a significant portion of my savings.

Of course on paper everything looks good and sounds promising. But reality often turns out differently.

That's why I'm here, Asking for a reality check.

I'll be honest. I've never read a book on business. Instead, I've spent the last three months researching nonstop, using AIs and online resources to understand how businesses succeed and why others fail. Every  night I go to bed overload with informations, processing them during the sleep.

I'm an extremely positive perdon. No matter the chsllenge, I'm determined to make this work and achieve my dreams. And one of my strongest skills is costumer service.

So, here's the question:

Does it make sense to build such an ambitious business as my first one?

Please feel free to share your thoughts, opinions, experiences or ask any questions. 

Thanks to everyone that have read all my post.

I'm a software engineer exploring an idea for a pre-packaged solution to support vibe coding: where developers rely primarily on AI (via natural language prompts) to generate, refactor, and debug code, instead of writing it all manually, but for corporate and enterprise clients looking to build efficiency.

Think: a fully-integrated local or cloud-based environment where you prompt, steer, and review AI output as your primary workflow ‚Äî similar to what some folks already do with Cursor and Windsurf, but designed to package all the 3rd-party tools and processes they use with an "AI-first" model in mind. Basically, building out an ecosystem that utilizes MCPs for agentic tooling, curated IDE AI rules, A2A standard for agent building, and a development process flow going from PRD-to-deployment-to-monitoring-to-maintainence.

Before going too far, I'd love your input:

1. **Does this resonate?** Is this kind of AI-first development environment something your team would realistically use ‚Äî or avoid? Why?
2. **What would it** ***need*** **to do well?** Code quality? Versioning? Prompt history? Multi-agent collab? Secure on-prem mode? Cache memory for reducing LLM calls? Other "guardrails?"
3. **Would your org ever pay for this?** (Or would this only work as open-source tooling, internal scripts, or layered onto existing IDEs?)

I‚Äôve read a bunch of dev discussions on this already, but I‚Äôd love to hear directly from those working on real-world projects or managing teams.

Any thoughts ‚Äî even skeptical ones ‚Äî are welcome. Just trying to validate (or kill) the idea with real feedback.

My name is Georgije, and for the past few months, I've been building my company, ConversifAI. The goal is to help businesses turn their internal knowledge (documents in Notion, Google Drive, Slack, Website etc.) into a smart AI assistant that can answer questions instantly.

The tech is solid (it's a RAG-based system), the website is up, and now I've hit the most important stage: getting it into the hands of a real business to solve a real problem.

This is where I could use your help.

I'm looking for 1-2 businesses that are struggling with knowledge management. Where I think this could be really strong:

* Your customer support team is overwhelmed with repetitive questions.
* Your new hires constantly have to ask where to find information.
* Your internal wiki or documentation is a black hole where information goes to die.

**The Offer:**  
I will personally build and integrate a custom AI chatbot for your business, completely free of charge for one month. There are no development costs, no hosting fees, no strings attached. It will use your company's data to provide accurate answers to either your customers or your internal team.

**What I'm asking for in return:**  
Honest, brutal feedback. I want to know what works, what's confusing, and what features you'd actually need. If you love it at the end of the month and it provides real value, a testimonial would be amazing. That's it. If you don't want to continue after the month, we part as friends, and you've had a free month of a custom AI assistant.

I'm doing this to learn and get that crucial first case study.

  Text: Everyone told me my SaaS idea was pointless because of free tools. I'm betting my visa and my savings that they're wrong. So, for the past couple of years, my life has felt like a giant bet against conventional wisdom.

On one hand, I'm a founder in Australia on a temporary visa. The "smart" play, the one everyone advises, is to get a sponsored job in a "safe" field or pivot my whole life towards a career on the government's priority list. It‚Äôs the path of least resistance.

On the other hand, there‚Äôs my startup idea. I want to use AI to make QR codes beautiful. Simple, right? But the moment I'd tell people, I'd get the same three responses, almost word-for-word:

1. "Dude, QR generators are free."
2. "Can't you just do that in Midjourney?"
3. "Why not just run Stable Diffusion locally?"

It was demoralizing. You start to think, "Are they right? Am I an idiot for trying to sell something people can technically get for free?" It felt like the universe was telling me to pick a safer idea.

But I couldn't shake this feeling that they were missing the point. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized both my visa situation and my startup idea were the same problem. The "safe" path isn't always the¬†rightpath.

My core belief is this:¬†**Nobody actually wants to use five different free tools to do one job badly.**

A marketing manager at a small cafe doesn't have time to wrestle with a Python script to run Stable Diffusion. She doesn't want to use a janky free generator, export the image, import it into Canva to add a logo, then use Bitly to create a trackable link, and then try to figure out Google Analytics.

She just wants a damn good QR code that looks great and tells her if it's working.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the whole thesis. Free tools aren't the competition; they are the lead magnet for a better, integrated workflow. They create the frustration that makes someone willing to pay. Think of Tally vs. Google Forms.

So that's what I'm building with my startup, Qreative AI. We're not just selling a pretty picture. We're selling a workflow. Create the art, manage the link, track the stats, and soon, capture the lead. All in one place. You're paying to get your time back.

I'm sharing this because I know I'm not the only one here trying to build a paid product in a sea of free alternatives. It's a grind, and the self-doubt is real. I'm literally betting my future in this country on the idea that "a better experience" is a feature worth paying for.

So, I'm genuinely curious to hear from others in this sub:¬†**Have you gone up against the "free" giant? How did you convince your first customers that your workflow was worth paying for? Did it work?**

- Working full-time actually helped - no pressure, pure experimentation
- Solving your own problem = automatic product-market fit validation

I launched 8 of them on Product Hunt. All of them flopped - barely scraping together 50 upvotes each while I watched other products soar past 500+.

That's a year of coding, designing, marketing, and grinding for basically nothing.

I was building what I *thought* people wanted, not what they actually needed.

Then I discovered BigIdeasDB and everything changed.

Instead of guessing what to build next, I started looking at what problems people were already talking about and asking for solutions to.

I found an idea on there that kept coming up: people struggling with Reddit marketing and content creation. They wanted an AI tool that could help with Reddit lead generation and create Reddit-style content.

So I built Linkeddit.

8 weeks later, I launched it on Product Hunt and hit #1 with 600+ upvotes.

Within the first month, I reached 1,500+ users.

But here's the thing - the product itself wasn't dramatically better than my previous 12 attempts. The difference was that I was finally solving a problem people actually had.

All those failed products taught me how to build and ship fast. But I was building solutions to problems that didn't exist.

The moment I switched from "what cool thing can I build?" to "what problem do people desperately need solved?" everything clicked.

My new approach is simple:

1. Research what people are actually asking for (BigIdeasDB, Reddit, Twitter, forums)
2. Validate the idea before writing a single line of code
3. Build the minimum version that solves the core problem
4. Launch and iterate based on real user feedback

If you're stuck in the cycle of building products that nobody wants, stop building and start listening.

Find the problems people are already talking about. Find the solutions they're already asking for.

Then build that.

Never give up. What's your excuse?

  Text: Need ideas for features I can add on my app So I have built an X/Twitter Automation app. I wanted to automate my posting on X since I don't log on my account a lot, so I built this app. 

As of now, the only features it has is:

* Connected to Groq for generating tweets
* Connected to X for posting them

I want to add some new features as well. What else should I add? I was thinking of training it on a certain data so it can fine tune Groq even more, but then I realized that it's my actual account, not a news channel and I can't be posting random posts. So now I am confused about what to add.

  Text: I will not promote. What's the weirdest healthtech startup idea you've heard of (or thought of)? will not promote. 

Healthtech is full of wild, unexpected ideas - from Al-powered diagnostics to wearable devices that track your sleep, to apps that remind you to drink water. Sometimes those ideas are genius. Other times... well, they're just plain weird.

  
We're curious: what's the strangest or most unexpected healthtech startup idea you've come across? Whether it was something you heard, worked on, or even dreamed up in a late-night brainstorm session. Bonus points for stories about why it didn't work (or why it might actually be brilliant).

  
Ready, set, share your wildest healthtech tales!

  Text: I'm selling a self hosted AI UGC platform, and I wanna make demo vids for some builders here. Hey everyone,

I built [oneugc.studio](http://oneugc.studio), it's a self hosted AI UGC platform where you can churn out content like never before.

Any viral format can be achieved with it. Grew it to 75+ clients thus far - they're all loving it.

I would like to make some demo clips for a select few builders from here - all I need from you is a product picture or video. I guarantee I'll be able to make 10+ clips without spending a dollar on costs myself due to the set up I built.

Comment if interested! I'll DM you and we'll make it happen.

  Text: AI6 - Agents SDK App AI6 is an AI agents application that uses the TS Agents SDK. There is a triage agent that hands off to the best agent for each task. It's been a nice way to experiment with different agents and get specialized results with handoffs. For example, the data science agent can clean and run analyses on a csv or json. 

If anyone wants to check it out and let me know what they think here's the link. The project is MIT/open source if anyone is interested in contributing as well.

  Text: 4 weeks ago we quietly launched Cofound. 180+ devs have joined. 21+ projects posted. Here are some of my favorites. Hey Guys

A few weeks back, we launched [https://cofound.co.in](https://cofound.co.in), a place for indie hackers, devs, and founders to **co-build side projects**, **find collaborators**, and **support each other without cringe networking.**

We didn‚Äôt do a big launch. Just started posting in corners of the internet where cool people hang out. And now 180+ devs have signed up. 21+ projects have been shared, and a few of them seriously blew my mind:

üß† **A neural net that runs on a TI-84 calculator and autocorrects words.**

üî§ **RadLang** ‚Äî a new programming language that blends Go‚Äôs simplicity with Python-style DSA, built from scratch with LLVM.

ü§ñ [**HoverBot.ai**](http://HoverBot.ai) ‚Äî turns a small business website into an AI-powered customer support & lead gen system using your own docs.

üìà **MVPBlocks** \- a fully open-source, developer-first component library built using Next Js and TailwindCSS, designed to help you launch your MVPs in record time. No bloated packages, no unnecessary installs‚Äîjust clean, copyable code to plug right into your next big thing.

And more like:

üß† AI that teaches you IIT JEE with YouTube-style videos + LLM-powered recall exercises

üìö ToonyTales ‚Äî auto-generate storybooks for kids with their name and favorite things

üìà A ChatGPT wrapper that answers real-time finance and stock questions

üéÆ A fan-made indie game inspired by SMG4, built by a remote team of hobbyists

**The vibe is:**  Cool & weird tech experiments, Indie games and open-source tools, AI side projects, researchy playgrounds, People building for fun, freedom, or future startups. People come in with raw ideas, offer feedback, ask for help, or just find someone to jam with.

‚ú® If you‚Äôre building something, looking to *join* something, or just wanna hang out with people who ship weird/cool things:

**‚Üí** [**https://cofound.co.in**](https://cofound.co.in)

**We‚Äôd love to have you. Feedback welcome, DMs open.**  
I also do a little feature of the projects I like ‚Äî ones that deserve more recognition ‚Äî right on Cofound‚Äôs landing page.

**DM me if you‚Äôd like to be featured.**

  Text: [For Hire] Full Stack Developer / RiveraSolutions ‚Äì RAG Demo with FastAPI + Supabase + OpenAI üëã Hey everyone!

I‚Äôm a Full Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience building intelligent web applications from scratch using¬†**FastAPI**, often integrating tools like¬†**OpenAI**,¬†**Google Gemini**, and¬†**Ollama**.

Today I‚Äôm excited to share a full-stack RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) demo I built:

üîç How it works:

1. Document ingestion: Users upload PDFs, Word docs, or Excel sheets.
2. Content processing: The app extracts text, splits it into logical chunks, and generates embeddings using the OpenAI Embeddings API.
3. Vector storage: Embeddings and metadata are upserted into a Supabase pgvector collection, with Row Level Security enabled to enforce fine-grained access control.
4. Similarity search: A top-K vector search retrieves the most relevant passages for any query.
5. Answer generation: Retrieved passages are fed to OpenAI‚Äôs Response API (gpt-4o-mini), producing concise, context-aware answers.

All API logic runs on FastAPI, while the frontend uses Jinja2 templates styled with TailwindCSS for a lightweight, responsive UI. The entire system is built for async performance, secure indexing, and rapid deployment.

  Text: Validating an idea: AI workspace that works on a canvas instead of chat I'm building a¬†**visual AI workspace**¬†that works how your brain actually thinks, not another linear chat interface.

The problem I'm solving: Every AI tool makes you re-explain your context every single conversation. You can't connect research from multiple sources. You lose your train of thought between sessions.

**The vision:**

* Drop in videos, PDFs, text files, voice notes, and websites as visual cards
* AI sees connections across ALL your content at once
* Learns YOUR writing voice from examples you upload
* Visual canvas where you build ideas instead of scrolling through chat history
* Context persists forever ‚Äî no more "explaining yourself" to AI

I want to avoid building another ChatGPT wrapper, so tell me:

* **Does context loss frustrate you with current AI tools?**
* **Would you pay $29-49/month if this saved you 5+ hours per week?**
* **What's your biggest pain point with AI for content/research work?**

Not launched yet. Just validating whether this scratches a real itch or if I'm solving my own weird problem.

Appreciate honest feedback, roast away if needed! üî•
