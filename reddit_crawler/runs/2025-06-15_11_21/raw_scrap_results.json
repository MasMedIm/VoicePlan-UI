I haven't seen too many around, but I like the one from Revolution Donuts. They also have lavender syrup, so I like to make it a lavender London Fog. 💜 Rev Coffee in Smyrna is on my wife’s list as well. I've found they can be really hit or miss everywhere. Which is wild to me since they aren't a complex drink. I've had a good one at Corner Cup (Decatur and Tucker area). Love the one at Coffee Man on the west side. I think the one at San Fransisco coffee is pretty good. I’m curious about this too! I’ve had good ones at Press & Grind, but it seems like it depends on the barista’s skill - they can be hit or miss. Kula coffee co in buckhead 🥳 Little Tart makes a yummy one! As a London Fog fanatic, Little tart makes the BEST- across the way Salted Donuts is pretty good. Revolution donut is great!

Thinking of those who have lost their dad or have a less than stellar dad. Thinking of hitting the Reptile Expo. I’ve lived in Atlanta for over a decade and never been. Did anyone go yesterday? I just woke up with a cold and thus will spend the rest of the day laying around in dramatic poses like a Victorian aristocrat painting. Happy Fathers Day to all you MFers out there It’s my wife’s bday! She requested a casual patio somewhere this evening so long as the rain holds off. Any recs? Morning peeps and Happy Father’s Day! I wish it would stop raining so I can catch up on yardwork 😭 I am thinking about moving to the Camp Creek Marketplace area and would love to hear from anyone who commutes from there to Midtown Atlanta. Could you share how long your daily commute takes and what time you usually leave? Especially when school is in session. Thanks!\n\nI was unable to make a post about this as mods requested I ask the question in daily discussion since it involves commuting. It's only 10:30 and I've already gone over my calorie burn goal by like 100. This is great because I fully intend to spend the afternoon on the couch \n\nHappy Sunday everyone. If you plan on fighting the humidity, I believe in you. Just make sure you hydrate Where are your favorite places to work from that will let you bring your dog? Hoping to find somewhere that isn't completely rambunctious (like fetch) as she's skittish. Bonus points if it has an inside area with AC",

Even though I clearly communicated to them that I required someone who knew what they were doing, they booked me with idiot girl who spent 2 sessions (several hundred bucks a piece and I'm self-pay) basically doing nothing beyond sitting there with her maw hanging open while she listened to me dump out all my trauma and cry. Each time I left feeling much worse than whenever I arrived and she never followed through with any of the things that she said she was going to do. After my second session I was pissed and went to look her up on the licensing website and that's where I found out that she was still under supervision and the ink had barely dried on her diploma. Fuck that \n\n\nDo not go to East Atlanta counseling center.\n\nFwiw, I ended up making a complaint to the licensing board, East Atlanta Counseling refunded my money because they knew damn well they'd messed up.

Looking for places where I could buy a rhubarb or strawberry rhubarb pie  Rhubarb season is over in zones 7a/7b, particularly with what a wet May we had (7\" total).  There may be a few slim holdouts, but any pie you get now will be from canned or processed rhubarb. \n\nordinarily with most fruit pies i'd say \"who cares go for it\" regarding processed fruits but rhubarb is something different altogether. wait until next year unless you can confirm a very late crop fresh rhubarb pie.  [https://www.southernbakedpie.com](https://www.southernbakedpie.com) \\- they do requests. They're in vinings. The Fresh Market chain usually has rhubarb pie Osono Bread at the Grant Park Farmers Market Sprouts had frozen rhubarb if you're interested in making one. (This is my favorite pie btw, good luck to you!) Pies by Julie @atlpiesbyjulie\n\nhttps://pies-by-julie.myshopify.com/?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwK67u5leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp26diBF9rPzxoX0P2AB5ZBtT_LBuOEV-YVShFV63468uDZ_Mxyj4uWF9RoZH_aem_y_C1GqiBDcApverlLwIAGA Fresh market is the only grocer I can find who sometimes carries a strawberry rhubarb pie. Call the bakery and ask when they will have them. They aren't seasonal. They just show up whenever.\n\nIf you want to try your hand at it, buy frozen rhubarb at Sprouts or even fresh and add some organic strawberries and sugar. It's an easy recipe but I made it too sweet and missed the tart of the rhubarb.\n\nThey're so good! I think Pies By Julie had them last week, not sure about coming up though. Maybe little tart bake shop? Got a strawberry-rhubarb at Mercier Orchards 3 weeks ago but maybe they're out. No idea how fresh it was. Their pies are goated though and they have like 20 flavors at any kind point and they're all delicious.",

    "chunk_text": "Bike shop recommendations? Hey there folks! I’m looking to restore my father’s old bicycle. Is there a bike shop you’d recommend? Ideally close to a Marta station but that’s not a big priority.  Loose nuts in grant park. Owner operated. There are a lot of good options in the city. Loose nuts is my favorite. Outback bikes are also great and closer to a marta station. Just a heads up, most good shops will try to talk you out of doing any kind of major work to an older bike.  It's just not worth the cost of parts plus labor compared to just buying a new bike.  I'm not saying they won't do it, but be prepared to pay up front.  Bike shops often get in these situations, order the parts, do the work, then the bike never gets picked up when the customer find out how much they actually owe.  \n\nBut yes, Loose Nuts are good folk. I just had my gear hub taken apart and re-tooled at Peachtree Bikes on N. Decatur and they were really quick and affordable. Great communication when they realized it was going to take a little more $ than originally quoted. Big peach midtown! Big peach is close to the midtown station and good Rei is literally next to the Sandy Springs Marta \n\nWhat’s the bike ? Loose Nuts gets all of my business. Always LNC. Best shop in the city. Sweet. I really just need a stuck seat post replaced and new wheels/tires. I should be able to do the rest since it’s not it too bad of a condition. It would just be cool to have a spot I can check out.",

We’re driving down from Chattanooga. I’m trying to figure out if there is a good MARTA station to park at that’s out of the city a bit and ride in. Then when we leave after, we ride back out and we’ll miss some of the traffic (in theory). Good idea or bad idea? Found some cool stuff at Scott Antique Market today. A couple of cool pieces of jewelry from a vendor I call Silver Lady 😆, and an intricate glass bowl from the vendor I call The Glass Lady 😆.\n\nHad some luck at the thrift store, too. I kind of want to start my own little side decor business. Yeah they are extra awful this year. Nothing seems to help in our yard this year either. Buckets with mosquito dunks, some other traps I bought etc.  Shit sucks. I've always been a mosquito magnet my whole life. I've added B1 and garlic supplements and it seems to be helping. Definitely not 100% reduction, but much less than I'm used to in the past. The genius that planted bamboo in my backyard (which helps breed mosquitoes) needs to step on a Lego barefoot.  I will say The Local has FANTASTIC wings and is dive-y. Big and juicy, and they got pretty good hot dogs and boiled peanuts too!",

Hiking trails also appreciated! It’s basic but you can’t beat piedmont it’s so big you can always find something new to see I've been heavily exploring the city by bike for the past 5 months and I feel like my favorite things I didn't expect were the west side reservoir, the west side beltline, Oakland cemetery, and the Adair parks. Also, freedom park had always somehow been invisible to me but makes for a great connection between downtown and the beltline.\n\nAlso, if you like outdoor pools Mozley Park is pretty nice. It's surrounded by trees and is splendid. Popular with kids but all ages are there and it's a vibe like every day it's open.\n\nEDIT: Ooh, I forgot, the Kirkwood Urban Forest Preserve was completely random and very easy to miss on a map but makes for a pretty nice walk. It's small but once you're inside you can find a nice bench and pretend you're in a forest miles from Atlanta. Same with westside resevoire honestly. I really love Grant Park. Lots of green space and the south east corner of it has a great view of the city. I genuinely love Historic Fourth Ward Park. It's busier and louder than a lot of other parks but it's maintained well and there are places that are quieter. big fan of parking at medlock park north of decatur and walking the south peachtree creek trail! it's a beautiful trail and very well maintained with some great spots to sit :) Oakland Cemetery Most of my favs have been mentioned but\n\n1) East Palisades. Go find the bamboo forest. It's magical.\n\n2) Morningside nature preserve- I've lived in Atlanta for years and I didn't discover this until 2020. And they have a mini bamboo forest too.\n\n3) Lionel Hampton Trail is mostly shaded so that's nice.\n\n4) Hahn woods. Um, if you are attentive, there's a way to walk to Lullwater Park from here. \n\n5) Speaking of which, Lullwater Park is magical too. You'd never expect that in the middle of Atlanta\n\n6) I have a soft spot for Grant Park. You can watch the elephants for free up on the grassy part of the parking deck. The meadow is good for picnics.\n\n7) DH Stanton Park is a hidden gym. It's got a great splash pad not many know about.\n\n8) Rodney Cook Park is beautiful.\n\n9) don't sleep on Westside park. It's relatively new and huge.\n\n10) cascade springs nature preserve is pretty interesting. If you visit, lemme know if you see the Santeria offerings. They were there the last couple times I visited Sweetwater creek state park I-20 west right past Six Flags. It is great if you wanna go outside downtown and it is close. Great hiking trails and a great big creek you can sit on the flat rocks in the water too off the hiking trails. Doll’s Head Trail. Weird, beautiful, peaceful. Also, muddy after a rain. It is of course Cochran Shoals. The real ones know.",

I train somewhat seriously for races and would love to find a group of people who are also aiming to train hard and maybe even be locally competitive.\n Atlanta track club Generally if you’re running sub 15 or 16 5k’s, you’re going to have to run by yourself since there’s a really small number of people who run times like those in general. I came to that conclusion to just training by yourself but run long distances socially. My 5k’s are sub 16 What's your pace normally? Besides ATC there is also an Atlanta Race Camp by the Atlanta Run Club that I’ve seen some people mention on Strava Agree that it depends on the types of runs you’re looking to do (tempos, thresholds, track intervals, standard training runs) and your pace in them. Atlanta Track Club (ATC) probably suits your sensibilities the most. There are a few run clubs in the city that feel like performative clout chasers. Atlanta Track Club, all the way! I love the community that I’ve built (I run with the Armory location at ATC headquarters). It’s definitely a great club for serious runners of all levels, and I love their training programs for half-marathons/marathons and the Peachtree Road Race. Plus, the Atlanta Track Club organizes great 5ks and 10ks and half/full marathons throughout the year that you get a discount on as a member (I’ve also had bad experiences with 5ks NOT organized by ATC.) can’t recommend them enough. Try the Nike Mondays at PCM, I think the proper name is Atlanta Run Club. Some of those folks are blazing fast. Inquire about the Atlanta Track Club Open Team (or Masters if older)",

Ya know…I was gonna bitch about the rain a bit, but then I saw the other comment positivity and decided against it. So I won’t say anything about how annoying these daily downpours have been and how I can remember the last full day of sun we had. Gahhhh all this positivity on the daily thread. We see you Fred Blankenship Y’all be safe this weekend. Sending you all some love and sunshine. Get out there today and kick a little ass. \nMy husband and I are childfree for the night for the first time since 2019. Big plans to hit the town tonight, trying hard not to act our ages and give into the urge to stay home. Let's make some noise this weekend folks!!! \n🚫👑 Been on a journey trying out coffee beans from all the local shops.  I'm on Postern right now which might be my favorite so far!  Up next is Perc.  They apparently have a monthly sale every 13th (today) where everything is 31% off so ordered a few bags. Today we're only being positive on here? I love this and hope everyone has a lovely day. Buying an eBike 2 weeks ago to 'stay in shape' was a decision that this rain has made me regret.\n\nEmbracing the positivity today, I'm gonna go ride the Comet today even if it IS RAINING.

I’m looking for options for beautiful stone for a kitchen. Help!  IKEA did my quartzite and it slaps… so you don’t have to break the bank.\n\nIf money were no object though, I’d find some guys to do a labradorite counter. You definitely don't want marble if you're looking at countertops. Even more so if you plan on cooking a lot. It stains and is damaged easily. https://thestonegal.com/\n I’ve used her twice for kitchen and bathroom. She lets you tour stone yards or sends you lots of options. We chose a Brazilian green veined marble for our kitchen. The price was better than what quartz people were quoting us. AGM Imports in Norcross has a huge inventory.\n\nAlso Legacy Countertops in Alpharetta has a much smaller inventory, but mentioning because I had an excellent install experience. And they happened to have a unusual quartzite that exactly fit my needs. I can't remember if we got our fancy quartz countertops here or just the tile. https://www.tileshop.com/tile CIOT on in West Midtown has high end slabs. You’ll need to work with a designer and fabricator though to get access to them. Cosentino in buckhead Inman Stone and Marble installed marble throughout our kitchen. They have a sealer that makes it so we can wipe away anything we spill on it. Wine, coffee, pasta sauce, all gone with no issue.",

    "chunk_text": "Boarding for elderly dog with health issues I am looking for a vet or boarding situation for my elderly dog with health issues. She has IBD (irritable bowel disease) but does seem controlled with medicine . The problem is she needs to go outside every 3 to 4 hours. I have to go away and am beside myself with how to board her . I called the place I normally board her and they asked if she could have diarrhea and I can’t  promise she won’t be in a different scary situation .   It is controlled at home. She is a good sweet natured dog with some health issues. Does anyone know of a “special needs” boarding situation in Atlanta (ITP)? You may be better off looking for in home care. These days it's not much of a price difference.\n\nRover is a start. If you know anyone who does it or other owners who can give you a referral, that's better I would look into someone who could come stay at your home with her. We did that for my dog for the last 4-5 years of his life. He didn’t have many health issues but he was very large and was less anxious at home.\n\nPrice wise it’s honestly comparable to most decent boarding services. I'd reach out to [Big Redd Dog Petsitting](https://bigredddogpetsitti.wixsite.com/big-redd-dog-pet) \\- they have a lot of sitters who are experienced volunteers with the local shelters.  Many board at their homes so you don't have to have someone stay at yours. I know a great pet sitting business. Very caring. Hello! I know you said you are not super interested in people coming to your house, but my pet sitter does an amazing job and specializes in special needs animals. If you change your mind, here is their contact info with the option to request service. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/allcreaturesatl/ If you're in Decatur or Avondale Estates, [ManyPaws Pet Sitting](https://manypawspetsitting.com/) is a good option. They stayed in our home with our dog a couple of times and did a great job caring for him and keeping us updated on his status. Sent you a direct message to your inbox Honestly, your best bet is to call some of the ones that get recommended here.  We board our dogs at Central Bark, and one of our dogs is elderly with heart disease, and they do a fantastic job in caring for her.  That said, I can't speak to how they would handle an elderly dog with IBD.\n\nI think your best bet is just to be very clear with your dog's current medical situation and any reputable place will give you an honest answer. https://www.trustedhousesitters.com I only do in home. Buckhead pet pals and Village Pets are both wonderful!",

Bonus if it’s a woman or just any provider that women have had good experiences with. Thanks in advance!  Scarlet Hurtnole @ Atlanta Integrative Psychiatry\n\nVery professional and down to earth. Doesn’t talk over you. Very attentive.\n\nOffers remote and on-site Dr Donielle Fagan I’m going to shout out to Brennan at Beal Wellness in East Point. The office is very much a local clinic vibe, not pretentious, and Brennan is fairly young and not overly-masculine. First visit would be in person, subsequent visits can be remote. Dr. Beal seems nice as well but the front desk suggested that Brennan was more progressive and in touch in some ways, when I asked them.\n\nThis isn’t a corporate-owned psychiatrist office, there are ways in which it is clear they have their priorities straight. Lifestance health they’re lovely. I specifically see Dr. Pulliam she’s great but they all are in that Brookhaven office I got to MindBodySoul in Decatur. The assessment itself isn't covered by insurance, but the appointments, meds, all that are. But to be honest with you, after a few meetings with Dr. Judith, she's told me i absolutely have adhd and we've been working together on finding the best medication for me, without having taken the assessment. Brandi Wells takes BCBS. Most evaluators don’t take insurance. Not sure how far north you’re willing to go but I just had my daughter evaluated (and am most likely going to have myself evaluated) at Fresh Start for the Mind. I went to the Canton office but I believe they have another one in Suwanee. They took our Anthem BCBS and we only have seen females there. It’s female and minority owned actually! Super easy process so far! The Neuropsychiatric Clinic of Atlantis.  I was able to see them remote and it was a female provider, very positive experience. I have Kaiser, and while I had to push my primary for the referral to get the assessment, the assessments did not cost me out of pocket at all. \n\nI do have to pay per session with my Psychiatrist, my specialist copay amount, and we do that about every 3 months. But I think thats more related to my history with depression Doctor Vallurupalli is a super awesome psychiatrist who really takes the time to fully explain how our brains work with ADHD and is heavily invested in continously learning more and more about the condition.",

Other than them apparently being super expensive lol Yeah, that is hilarious, trying to write an \"article\" for people with tiktok brains that wouldn't be reading in the first place It’s Axios’ writing style for all their articles. They call it “Smart Brevity”, the founder wrote a whole book on its merits to convey messaging.  They started out as an email newsletter, and it really makes sense in that context. \n\nLike it or not, at least they have a reason and are consistent. I personally kind of prefer it for shorter articles like this. If it wasn't written by AI, they tried their hardest to make it appear so I am so sure this was written by AI Stupid, ignorant comment.\n\nThis has always been Axios' style guide, and it works.

Do I want money and more social interaction or do I want to be a feral goblin in peace? A few weeks ago I missed the deadline to book within the room block for a wedding I'm attending this weekend, so I booked separately a few days later.

Decisions, decisions...\n\n\nEdit - Decided to stay at the (wrong) place I booked. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, or something 😅 It's my birthday and squaring up to be the worst birthday of my life. 27 and my life is going nowhere Is it just me or are the mosquitoes extra bad this year?

I might visit the Marietta and/or Cobb Antique mall today, but I'm not sure vendors there sell watches. I've been reconsidering my idea to start a cult. I would really love to get a big group of like minded people together, have everyone give me their money and resources and set up nice haven for everyone to live happily and in an actual community.

I enjoy all types of Asian food (want to explore beyond the regular Japanese and Korean) and would love to check out Latin American or Caribbean food which is not crazy expensive since I'm a student. Any suggestions would be appreciated! [MARTA dining guide](https://roughdraftatlanta.com/marta-dining-atlanta-restaurants/) Almost anything in Decatur or take the bus up Buford Highway. Take the gold line up to the chamblee exit, there's tons of choices within a few feet to the right or left of the train exit several which are cuisines which you mentioned. Decatur station has a ton.\n\nEdgewood station would give you access to Bona Fide Deluxe and a short walk to others, and the Edgewood shopping center.\n\nInman Park station would give you access to all the restaurants in Inman Park, plus beltline access with a ton there, plus L5P if you dont mind walking/scooting. Kittydare The Decatur station is right in the middle of downtown Decatur, so there's a bunch of good spots within easy walking distance of there, bad restraunts don't survive, so hard to go wrong, but Chai Pani would be what i'd call out specifcally on a student budget.\n\nAlso the 39 bus that runs between Chamblee and Lindbergh station runs every 20 mintues, so anything along that corridor is also easily accessable. Some random places off the top of my head along that route are Lee's Bakery (vietnamese), Food Terminal (Maylay Chinese), Best BBQ (Cantonese bbq and noodle dishes), and Northen China Eatery.\n\nFrom North Ave Station the 2/102 buses  run frequently down Ponce, and they'll get you to Ponce City Market which has some good options inside, and puts you right on the beltline, which can be a nice way to kill an off day. \n\nKrog Street is along the beltline, and a bit of a hike along such either from Ponce City or from King Memorial (or Inman Park) stations, but it has IMO the best cheesteak in town at Freds Meat and Bread, plus Superica is a solid texmex place.\n\nI'm sure i'm missing some good places, but that's a start. following recommendations are all an \neasy walk from train station listed and very good restaurants!\nChamblee station:\nsouthbound, Antigo Lobo, blue top  \n\nDecatur Station :\nLeon’s full service , the brick store pub, Café Alasace, the Iberian pig, \nA little further from the station, but definitely worth the walk : the Kimball House, Chai Pani, \n\nBrookhaven station :\nTerra Terroir If you don't mind a bit of a walk (25-30 minutes) you can go to gsu or king memorial station and walk down to summerhill where there's a whole strip of restaurants. Five points, gsu, and Peachtree center are all downtown too and there are a ton of restaurants around there. Some restaurants on dekalb ave too (east point, inman park, and Edgewood stations). And ofc Decatur station is right in downtown Decatur and there are tons of options around there All of Downtown Decatur > I enjoy all types of Asian food (want to explore beyond the regular Japanese and Korean) and would love to check out Latin American or Caribbean food which is not crazy expensive since I'm a student.\n\nLike someone else said, take the bus up to Buford Highway.

Preferably different styles, including salsa, bachata, etc. Thanks in advance! hi - there are many places to go social Latin dancing! feel free to google them for timings/prices and all of them have instagram accounts that you can check. Though mostly these start at around 9:30-10pm and go on till 1-2am. Many of these places have a quick class at 9:30 before dancing starts.\n\nthere are usually 2 types of places you can choose to go to:\n\n* ones at clubs/restaurants where the vibe is more casual/beginner friendly and usually these are on a weekly/biweekly frequency \n   * 1st, 3rd and 5th Tuesday – BachaTuesday (Cafe Almenara) \n   * Every Wednesday – Tongue & Groove Latin Night \n   * Every Thursday - Eclipse Di Luna, Dunwoody (i believe the Buckhead one has it on a different day) \n   * Every Friday – Sanctuary Night Club \n   * Last Sunday of the month - Salsa Zero ATL (Very beginner friendly)\n\n\n* other category includes more serious dancing with quite many professional folks, these usually happen once a month (many of these are associated with dance classes) \n   * 1st Friday – La Mezcla Dance Social (Aatma Dance Studio in Chamblee) (this is where I have been learning since couple of years and its a great social to start with!) --Free Practice Hour also at Aatma Dance Studio every Wednesday at 9pm. Come and dance with the students after class. This is primarily focused towards our current and past students, but it is also open to the public. and you can bring some drinks & snacks to share! \n   * 1st Saturday – Ritmos del Barrio (Academy Ballroom in Buckhead) \n   * 2nd Saturday – Tumbao (Elements Dance Studio) \n   * 3rd Saturday – Mambo Mayhem (Atlanta Dance and Music Academy) \n   * 4th Saturday – PasoFino Dance Social (Academy Ballroom in Buckhead)\n\nHope you have a lot of fun dancing about!! The community is great and very welcoming! Not a club suggestion but if you join Aatma Dance Studio they often have like social gatherings/parties. They teach salsa and bachata. It's a great community they have a Whatsapp group and everyone just posts in there every so often about parties they'll throw. I love how thorough this response is! Thank you!",

Unfortunately, there aren't really any good options locally.  Barnes and Noble is probably the best which is just sad.  But at least they have a decent amount of Arrow/Criterion.  If you want to support a great small shop that offers shipping, check out [Orbit DVD](https://www.orbitdvd.com/) or visit them in Asheville. For new, I only know of Barnes and Noble. Unfortunately their selection isn't great (at least the one in Buckhead), and their pricing is terrible. They price everything at the MSRP that even the labels themselves never sell for. They usually have 50% of Criterion and Arrow sales, and that's really the only time it's worth it. \n\nThe best route is ordering from diabolikdvd.com or orbitdvd.com One of the biggest advantages of Blu-ray and dvd is the durability of the media. Why are you against buying used?  Great bargains, and it’s environmentally responsible. Walmart has new blurays. Some 4K and some new vinyl and new CD's. Try the mega Walmarts.. They also have complete TV seasons. \n\nAre you planning on collecting only brand new 4K? Because you should go the next step to steelbooks.\n\nSome media is OOP and you are going to have to settle for what is available. Have you tried 2nd & Charles? There's one in Kennesaw and Roswell. I have seen a fair share of brand new ones at thrift stores. Likely from stores that closed and donated them. But that’s the only place I’ve seen them Try 2nd & Charles! my walmart has them Suncoast, FYE, Sam Goody, Borders The mall",

Would that really revitalize downtown, bridge socioeconomic gaps and blah blah blah? I thought you were kidding, but…\n\n> The funding comes from the Neighborhood Access and Equity Program, a provision based on Williams’ Neighborhood Access and Equity Grants Act\n\nWas so excited about this one, every time I drive that section of the downtown connector I think about it. Hopefully we can figure out funding elsewhere. Literally. The stitch would be overly expensive and not even that nice. \n\nA nice solution that would be much cheaper is to close all car traffic and build a canal. \n\nChicago shouldn’t be the only city in America where you can ride a boat in a location where there are skyscrapers all around you\n\nA ferry would also be quicker than the current level of traffic on the connector too The connector really does split the city incredibly badly. I think the Stitch should be considered the first phase for other caps along the Connector, though the at-grade portions north of 10th and south of Freedom Parkway make it more problematic. To really fix the split, GDOT would have to de-freeway the Connector and turn it into a city street/boulevard.\n\nIn other words, that ain't happening.",

I like the Morningside location more, but the Phipps one has a larger olive section. \n\non a $$+ budget, Capella Cheese. this place rocks, highly recommend the acorn chorizo and all the cured meats.  They have a lot of cheese and some olives that are both really hard to find in Atlanta. \n\non a $$$ budget or higher, i'm not too sure since I can't ball that way.  Star Provisions Alon'$ Grant park market!!!

Took an anniversary trip down to Quito Ecuador (still here). \n\nCan not recommend highly enough coming from someone that has done Lima, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Bogotá, and Santiago (all have their upsides).  There are direct flights from ATL, only 4.5 hrs. \n\nTourism is down since COVID and the dollar both goes far there and their official currency. They’re coming out of their winter now (only 2 seasons winter/summer). Right on the Equator. We’re staying for around $40 per night in a nice modern apartment in a great area of town. Meals (like, nice ones) are $10-15 pp. all Ubers around the city are $4 or less. Fascinating history, excellent food, and lots of high altitude outdoor activities. Best and oldest chocolate in the world. \n\nCome on down! Around 7:30 or so last night, I was driving eastbound on I-20 and saw a rainbow that looked like it was coming out of a MARTA train. Then on southbound 75/85, it was raining on the northbound side only. Rainbow was still visible all the way home. Happy Pride?! This is my 4th summer in ATL and I feel like running early in the morning finally became possible for me. This might be the year that my fitness doesn't completely drops to zero during summer. Nothing like waking up an hour before your alarm to the lovely sound of your dog puking in the living room\n\nUpdate: well I’ll be darned, the $55 rug I bought from Target that claims to be “machine washable” did in fact survive the washing machine. (I partially bought it as an experiment because like…a $55 living room rug??) Now to see if it fairs as well in the dryer Good morning everyone! Have the best day possible! Leaving for Bonnaroo in a couple hours. So many butterflies. I've been to 50+ festivals but always get butterflies on the travel day. This time around it doesn't seem real. I'm about to see King Gizzard become mainstream. 3 nights of the best band on earth. And as I'm working media, holding out for the miracle I can interview them let alone just meet them. Giddy as a 33 year old dude. I hope everyone can find that magic that makes them giddy 6 AM on a Wednesday. Happy Roo! Anybody for recommendations for an orthopedic doc? I had one but it's getting worse and not happy with my care strategy. Particularly for lower back issues. Has anyone gotten their tax rebate yet? I'm still waiting.

Lowering speeds means nothing if they don’t increase enforcement or redesign streets to force people to slow down. They have 3 people out there dancing in traffic cone costumes. Sadly this will have little impact, even if enforced.  There are many studies that demonstrate that speed is a function of the road's design, location, etc.  I suspect this will cause more heartburn than not, but I recognize that at the very least it functions as acknowledgement of the problem. It's a good move but there's reasonable speed limits all over town. How about increasing enforcement? Honestly just make roads impossible to drive fast without hitting another car and you’ll solve so many issues with pedestrian and cyclist safety. 25 on Dresden is ridiculous. It's a cash grab that has nothing to do with safety What this means is they just increased their budget and need more revenue. As if it isn’t already a huge pain in the ass to get through Brookhaven Revenue not safety is the goal.",

    "chunk_text": "Low voltage interior electrician for specialty lighting recommendation needed I'm looking to hire someone to install LED motion sensor lights under each step in my staircase. They are called piano lights that light up sequentially with motion. I've had three electricians come by and they all recommend a low-voltage electrician that specialize in lighting. However I have been unable to find one online. Does anyone have any recommendations? Those electricians didn’t want to deal with the electronics and any finish work like stairs, not worth their time. \nIf they are bare wooden stairs I’d talk to a finish carpenter, most of the work will be the modification of the stairs anyway, they can even mount the lighting and you or an electrician can wire it up. out of 3 electricians that came to your house, all 3 were somehow unable to provide you any recommendations? Weird. \n\nhttps://verify.sos.ga.gov/verification/Search.aspx\n\nunder \"profession\" select Low Voltage and search. that will provide hundreds of pages of all certified LV contractors in the state. then filter by the area where you live. \n\nAlso btw here in GA, a Class 1 Electrical License authorizes any holder of the license (or any employee of the contractor holding the license) to repair or install any single phase system or device under 200 amps. So if the three electricians that came to your place were licensed, then all three of them are properly trained in LV and could legally install your stair lights. My guess is they all just did not want the job ...  If you wanted to do this and have it switchable/direct wired then it is going to cost a lot of money and be difficult to find someone to do it. I'm just some guy that does maintenance in a factory, so outside of there I'm not \"authorized\" to do this type of work. I could, but without looking I would estimate $4k + parts, and then around $150 to have a licensed electrician that normally does residential work to come out and do the final connections to your main electrical panel to finish the job \"legitimately.\" It may be possible to do it for way less, but it all depends on what wire access and mounting locations are available and how sleek you want it to be. Recess mounting would look great, but add a whole level of complexity. \n\n\nIf you really want it that badly then you could keep looking and find someone else that is more qualified, but I feel like they may end up charging you even more than that. It's just a ton of wiring, and more to the point of difficulty is that the wires have to be neat and out of sight. It's just a lot of work.\n\n\nAnother option here is to just get online and search for \"motion sensor color light\" and get something battery powered that mounts easily. Sure, you'll be changing or charging batteries every couple of weeks or months depending on what you get, but it'd just be a lot less complicated. Veaya from Mr Electric installed some outdoor lights for us recently and did a great job This is closer to the real answer, probably. Typically, this type of lighting is a strip that runs under the lip of each stair.  The problem is, stairs have a lot of building code requirements around them that an electrician isn't going to know about. Depending on the light, you might need to modify the stair to hide the light and wiring by creating a bit of a recess under the tread.  You probably want to do this by building up the edge of the tread, as routing a channel under the tread might cause structural issues.  The problem is increasing the depth of the tread, you might run up against some code but I can't think of one.  Either way, it's not something an electrician wants to guess about either.\n\nYou probably need a good carpenter that will then sub out the electrical.  While any electrician can do it legally, most aren't going to want to learn how to do it as it's not going to be a simple setup and they for sure don't want the warranty work.\n\nThere are home automation companies that [specialize in this type of lighting](https://atlantaaudio.com/solutions/smart-home-automation?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=automation&gclid=Cj0KCQjwmK_CBhCEARIsAMKwcD48I_-GNJvmOZKsvg43Up3Osu3FC0VOBMG9Q8E7WsCW1HU8BEDa-u0aAp4EEALw_wcB&utm_term=home%20lighting%20control%20system&utm_campaign=EMC+-+Rework+061121&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5466999301&hsa_cam=13476827221&hsa_grp=162594901616&hsa_ad=698998667697&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-307840027408&hsa_kw=home%20lighting%20control%20system&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21276291080) and could be a one-stop shop. I’m specifically asking about specialty interior lighting for low-voltage lights. The three electricians that came for estimates all do outdoor lighting, but cannot do low voltage interior lighting. That’s surprising. Most exterior yard lighting is low voltage. They probably just don’t want to work around a finished interior.",

It was definitely hot and the chicken was salty enough on the inside but it's like the seasoning on the outside was only cayenne? Ive tried Princes in Nashville and their seasoning was hot but also had other flavors going on instead of just cayenne flavor. Maybe I just went in on an off day but I'm open to any suggestions as I'm fiending for good hot chicken right now. \nP.S I know there's a few places with tenders but it doesn't hit the same as dark meat Try some of the Korean fried chicken places up in the NE burbs.\n\nMaybe Java Saga on BuHi has something similar too I like Gus’s - that was the spot that switched me to ordering thighs as the majority haha. \n\nIt’s not a traditional Nashville hot but it’s very tasty. \n\nScoville is tasty as well but I’ve only ordered the sandwiches there. Which temperature did you have at Hattie B's? The tender places suck. Hattie Bs is usually decent. But I've had it where there isn't enough of the chili-oil on the chicken. \n\nWe aren't spoiled with good hot chicken options here afaik. But there are several good Korean Fried chicken places that do great bone-in fried chicken.\n\nThat said, I too would love to know of a good Nashville hot place. \n\nMaybe Eugene's could expand over here from Bham... You will not find chicken comparable to Prince’s anywhere. Not even in Nashville. And if you do, please let me know!\n\nGus’s is delicious but an entirely different product.\n\nThe few times I’ve been to Hattie B’s the damn hot was pretty good. Shut the cluck up was always powdery and gross. Hop's Nashville hot chicken at Ponce City market does a really good spicy bone-in chicken. I got a thigh and a chicken sando, and was throughly impressed by each. Want to say it's better than Hattie B's but need to revisit to be sure.\n\nEdit: spelling Kinda not what you asked for but related, Argosy in EAV has a GREAT hot chicken sandwich. FWIW the hot catfish sandwich at fishmongers slaps. Highly recommended. Their homemade hot sauce is good and I usually hit it pretty hard with that as well. \n\nFamily Dog used to have hot chicken and waffles that were damn good.  They have a Nashville chicken sandwich, but I haven't  had it so it may not be the same recipe. Have you tried Pelicana on 14th?\n\n4.9 Stars of 4,979 ratings Gus’s World Famous Fried Chicken",

It works fine but if more than one person is talking, the online player can't understand what is going on. \n\nMy idea is to buy those cheap mini-mics that you see people use for videos outside / podcasts and have each of the players hook one to themselves. I see a lot of 2 mics + connector things on amazon and the price is pretty good looking to me. I am just concerned that we would have the same issue of two people talking at the same time and the online player can't understand anything though. \n\nObviously, I could just buy individual mics but that sounds too efficient and is probably more expensive. \n\nAnyone have thoughts?",

I thought you used to be able to do this at Wild Heaven but seeing that they serve food now. Thank you! You can kind of do this at Lee + White. Bring food, get beer from Wild Heaven or Monday Night, and sit in the public areas. Outrun in Stone Mountain. A good amount of breweries (particularly ones with large patio space and chill day to day) will be fine with you bringing your own food. Off the top of my head, I think both Monday Night locations, the outdoor garden for Halfway Crooks, both Scofflaw spots, Round Trip…honestly probably the outside West End space for wild Heaven and definitely their Decatur space, Three Taverns…I don’t see there being an issue from visits to these locations, from seeing customers doing it, and from employees being cool with it. Round Trip in West Midtown. The only possibility I can think of is Little Cottage, which is a metal bar and not for everyone. All the other breweries have food now. Not on the east side, but I imagine you could easily eat outside with your own food at Scofflaw at The Works.   \n   \nGuess maybe you could do the same outside of Imaginarium on the east side near the Eastern? Didnt think they had a full kitchen or anything. I have taken my own food to the original Monday Night when sitting outside and had no issues. They do have the pizza but no one mentioned anything to me. The quickest way to find out this info is to call and ask Wild Heaven in Toco Hills. It's technically also a Fox Bros location, but the outside with the benches is public space and you can bring whatever you want in there. Any truck and tap location (closest to me is Duluth)",

And don’t even mention swallowing—none of them have let him finish down their throat. Yet.\n\nThat’s what I’m looking for.\n\nNot a threesome. Not drama. Just  real women who wants to be watched. Who enjoys the pressure, the stretch, the challenge—and doesn’t back down. You’ll be seen, appreciated, and remembered every time I replay it in my head.\n\nIf you’re confident, local, and know your mouth is built for more than talk—reach out. I’ll be the one responding.
