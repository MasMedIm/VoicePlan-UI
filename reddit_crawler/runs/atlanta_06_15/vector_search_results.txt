Please report any offending comments so that the moderators can remove them.* I have the day off and I woke up at 6:45 on the dot 😂 have been laying in bed since. Beats being at work! Happy Friday! My SO has been depressed so I've spent the past year doing all the chores and trying to tough out a rough time in our marriage and deal with the lack of emotional support from them. It finally got to me on May 13 and I broke down to the point that my therapist recommended an in-patient facility for me. 


My SO filed for divorce the very next day. Wasn't even gonna tell me. Wrote a note they planned to leave and just ghost me. They couldn't support me for one day in the same way I'd supported them the past year. They've been asking for money frequently over the past year and I didn't worry about it, thinking if we ever did split up that it would be reallocated to me. Wrong. It's seen as gifts to the court. $25K of my money is just theirs now, despite them making more. 


Everyone says marriage can be tough, and I was trying to be a good partner, thinking that I had their back and they had mine. Turns out this was just a transaction to them. I'm gutted.  Last week I applied for a job, and heard back the next day asking for my portfolio, and then they requested an interview! This moved so quickly normally I'd think it was a scam, but it's actually legit.  
  
I had a great interview yesterday and I think this would be a good fit for both parties, so please send lots of good vibes/prayers/positive war chants in my direction. 😆

Also I've been funemployed since January and could really use a breakthrough haha 🥲 is it just me, or are there more potholes than ever in this god forsaken city Hey everyone, will be in Atlanta for three weeks or so during the Club World Cup. Just saying hello and may have a question from time to time.

Will be staying near Civic Centre MARTA stop, which I know is not ideal location but seems ok for some transport (won’t have a car). Which is better out of Lyft or Uber, or are they about the same?

This morning everyone I listed as references texted me and said they were contacted, and that my interviewer was really intrigued by me, that they really liked me, and that overall they were really positive about me 😊😊😊

Is this my time to shine? I hope I'll have another *(positive)* update later in the week 🤞 Mornin’ peeps Its my boss's retirement party day. Going to miss her and I am not excited for whoever they choose as a replacement. Forecast shows rain for a whole week with exception of a surprisingly sunny Wednesday.

Edit- was sitting somewhere almost off the grid and didn’t check spelling Hello, we are coming to an event in a few weeks at Mercedes Benz. We’re driving down from Chattanooga. I’m trying to figure out if there is a good MARTA station to park at that’s out of the city a bit and ride in. Then when we leave after, we ride back out and we’ll miss some of the traffic (in theory). Good idea or bad idea?

The Taco Mac Brewniveristy helped me really enjoy and learn what I liked about craft beer years ago. That location, you were lucky if they had 50% of the drink menu in stock. Service was so slow. Food quality got worse and worse.  
  
Hoping for another sports bar there. Fado is solid tho. I don't think they closed due to anything except mismanagement. I need more friends lol seeing metallica tonight at the benz!! beyond stoked Putting this out into the world is dangerous at best but here I go:

I'm now waiting for the Cat Distribution System to visit me. So food spilled in my car and it smells. I have tried vinegar, baking soda, enzyme sprays. I think I need to get it professionally done. Any recommendations to get rid of smells in the car?

In other news, I started going to the gym with a buddy of mine. He has been lifting for years while I have not. I didn't realize that we had an abusive relationship until now because I am hurting. Bench press form is unintuitive as hell.

A tree fell on someone’s car at my apartment complex and totally crushed it! I feel so bad for the owner because it was an older car and the car market right now is so rough. I've been without power since about 5:30pm yesterday and it sucks. I am not scheduled to get power back until later this afternoon, either.
  
This is the longest power outage I've experienced in this house in the 10 years that I've been in this house.

I am pretty sure my fridge and freezer food is spoiled. I guess it's a good "excuse" to purge and deep clean the fridge and the chest freezer this week. Georgia is the only place I've lived where the power goes out .. 7/10 times it rains. Or is windy. Or snow. Or is too hot. Back on the road. One of these days, I'll spend more than 5 consecutive days in my own home again. I look forward to that day. Happy Sunday y'all ✨

We shall take that as a win. everyone have a good hump day, homestretch y’all!! Took an anniversary trip down to Quito Ecuador (still here). 

Can not recommend highly enough coming from someone that has done Lima, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Bogotá, and Santiago (all have their upsides).  There are direct flights from ATL, only 4.5 hrs. 

Tourism is down since COVID and the dollar both goes far there and their official currency. They’re coming out of their winter now (only 2 seasons winter/summer). Right on the Equator. We’re staying for around $40 per night in a nice modern apartment in a great area of town. Meals (like, nice ones) are $10-15 pp. all Ubers around the city are $4 or less. Fascinating history, excellent food, and lots of high altitude outdoor activities. Best and oldest chocolate in the world. 

Come on down! Around 7:30 or so last night, I was driving eastbound on I-20 and saw a rainbow that looked like it was coming out of a MARTA train. Then on southbound 75/85, it was raining on the northbound side only. Rainbow was still visible all the way home. Happy Pride?! This is my 4th summer in ATL and I feel like running early in the morning finally became possible for me. This might be the year that my fitness doesn't completely drops to zero during summer. Nothing like waking up an hour before your alarm to the lovely sound of your dog puking in the living room

Update: well I’ll be darned, the $55 rug I bought from Target that claims to be “machine washable” did in fact survive the washing machine. (I partially bought it as an experiment because like…a $55 living room rug??) Now to see if it fairs as well in the dryer

It made me sad seeing how empty the Beacon is these days now that Eventide and Elsewhere have closed. Hopefully that area can bounce back! Welcome to Atlanta summers, where my glasses fog up when I go outside even if it’s early morning I made a huge batch of roasted chipotle in adobo salsa today hoping it would be medium spicy. It was not medium spicy. I do be sniffling, sneezing, coughing, cursing, and crying Virginia Highland Summerfest is today and tomorrow. Don't sleep on this great free festival. Well that was one heck of a storm. Power's out. I was out and about when it happened, so I am guessing that the power's been out for about an hour. No ETA for restoration. Boo :(

Guess I'm take a nap with my dogs 😀

I will say I have been attempting to get back into dating over the past few weeks. I just refuse to go back to dating apps. I went [back to this challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/s/7gIj1fO5mh) and made some observations. I’m great with starting conversations, just overthink the whole flirting aspect of things. At least I know I’m moving in the right direction. 

I’m grateful to make it 10 weeks, shows me that I can actually commit to something. Here’s to 10 weeks of sobriety. My weather app must be out of sync. 72? With humidity I was thinking it was 92. Gonna be a looong summer. I should really get a roommate, but gosh having someone living in my space seems so daunting. Do I want money and more social interaction or do I want to be a feral goblin in peace? A few weeks ago I missed the deadline to book within the room block for a wedding I'm attending this weekend, so I booked separately a few days later. NBD....or it *wouldn't* have been a big deal, if I had booked at the correct hotel and not a different one down the road. 🤣 Now I get to figure out if I want keep my original reservation at the wrong hotel, where I can easily avoid my family, or cancel it and stay with everyone else. Decisions, decisions...


Edit - Decided to stay at the (wrong) place I booked. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, or something 😅 It's my birthday and squaring up to be the worst birthday of my life. 27 and my life is going nowhere

It’s great to see people checking in and wanting people to succeed [like this person](https://imgur.com/a/4sy310u). Thank you for checking in on me. From the bottom of my heart I truly appreciate it. 

Also I’ve been on this self isolating journey. I had to examine every friendship that I have an evaluate whether it is a true friendship or just holding on to old memories. Some only spoke to me if I reached out first, some we didn’t have in common besides the weed and alcohol, and some we just outgrew each other since we’re in different stages in life. I had to understand it’s okay to let it go. Creates room for new friendships and connections. 

I’m still holding on strong even after 9 weeks. Hasn’t been pretty yet still fighting through it. Anything worth having is worth fighting for. Those words have never been so true. Cheers to 9 weeks sober. 

Also here’s another [keyboard warrior](https://imgur.com/a/S1kfHfy) Today is my ten year anniversary at work and thus my ten year anniversary of coming to Atlanta. I got a call, quit a job, and drove across the state in the middle of the night to start my new career with an employee appreciation picnic. At least half the people I met that day are retired now. 

I lived in an efficiency apartment for that whole first year because I was the last person in my department hired before the GPC/GSU merger and I didn't know if I would be the first one laid off. 

Gonna go see Dogma tonight to celebrate. 

Here's to the next ten, Atlanta! Update on the debt journey: after today's payment, I am nearly nearly there. I have some recurring payments this month that will put me over the expected amount left to fully clear my last card next pay period, but I'm so close that I'll just borrow from savings to kill it. It's so exciting that I will gladly stick to my budget and grind it out the next few weeks.

In other news, watching my dog look out the window is always so comforting :)

Happy Thursday! I’m excited for my friend Raymond’s show at the Center for Puppetry Arts. It’s called Ninja Puppet Shenaniganza and looks like it’s going to be fun Everyone be safe out there and hug your loved ones extra hard today, the world is such a scary place.

Got delayed a third time and they finally said it was having battery/electrical issues. That stuff can be a pain to ever get sorted, so I don’t want to roll the dice on that. At least they were fast with the refund and the money is already back in my bank account.

Going to give up on Carvana and just buy something local. Going to spend a bit more and get something a bit newer and dealer certified pre-owned I think. I keep my cars a long time (will be moving on from a 2008 Mazda 3) so I’d rather have more peace of mind on reliability/longevity and having some dealer warranty on powertrain etc. Leaning toward a Mazda CX-5 after more research. Like the design of them better than CRV and the 2022-23 models have some good options used and reviewed better than CRV and RAV 4 those years. Going to check some out and maybe buy if I like one Friday. Is there a place where I can try out and purchase used cameras? I've always wanted to start photography as a hobby and I thought it would be best to actually try cameras out instead of blindly ordering a used one online. Somewhere around Sandy Springs/Dunwoody would be best but I'm willing to drive out further! After putting it off for years, I finally got some vegan Italian “beef” (seitan) from Buona in Chicago just as I think they are discontinuing the at home version they put out.

So far, surprisingly, Macy's in Lenox Mall had a good selection of Hamilton, Longines, and Rado watches.  The other stores, like Nordstrom, only carried Tissot and Seiko watches.  Don't mind those brands, but *every* store has them.  All the other stores in Lenox are brand specific, and I'm not in a position to buy a Grand Seiko, Tudor, or similarly priced watch.

I hate the idea of spending $1500 online for something I can't try on.  Farer watches look really cool but they don't sell them locally.  There are a lot of cool microbrands out there but the problem is you can only see them online. Metallica puts on a great show. Was my first concert at the Benz. Very excited about INK two-day run at Tabernacle. Silver Scream 1 and 2 are cool concept albums.
