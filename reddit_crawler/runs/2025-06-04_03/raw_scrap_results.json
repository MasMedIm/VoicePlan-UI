    "chunk_text": "Should I leave my fulltime job for a startup? (advice needed) I will not promote Hi everyone,\n\nI have a couple of hard decisions to make. I’ve been working at a startup on the side for the last 8–9 months now and currently hold 10% equity. The rest is split between the two co-founders, and overall, we’ve made a solid team so far, although we had some issues along the way.\n\nIn the last 4 months, both my co-founders decided to go full-time (one is on paid garden leave, the other on paid leave but switching to unpaid soon), while I’ve continued working part-time, putting in 30–35+ hours a week, on top of my full-time management consulting job, which puts my total hours at around 80–90 per week.\n\nWith the job market being so terrible for consulting/tech, I am worried, what would happen if we failed, one of the founders is on garden leave and will be paid for 2 years and the other is on leave but can return to his job, am worried if we fail I need to go back into this terrible job market.\n\nRecently, there’s been talk of me going full-time to increase my output, but I’m having a hard time justifying the jump. The startup is fully bootstrapped, and I’d have to leave my only source of income while living in an HCOL city. On top of that, there have been discussions about reducing my equity if I stay at my job, or having to contribute more to the bootstrapping fund in order to keep it.\n\nI’m really conflicted because I’m down to work hard and keep putting in the hours, but going full-time feels like a huge risk, especially considering I have significantly less equity and less financial runway than the other two.\n\nSome background: our product’s been growing fast, we recently hit around 380K monthly users last month, which is a 10x jump from the month before. But ironically, we made less money due to higher server costs and a lack of monetization. We just started implementing ads, but haven’t seen a major revenue increase yet, and are currently sitting at around $2–3K/month. I think it will get better in the future, but this is the current state. Also, I am a new grad who has been working for about a year now, so I know that I can take more risks, but I don't want to fall off the deep end either.\n\nAny advice is appreciated :)",

Started dropshipping back in 2017 with like $200 and way too much free time lol. Had zero clue what I was doing. No YouTube guru, no course, just me googling \"how to sell stuff online\" at 2am.\n\nFailed hard for months. Made maybe $6k total and thought I was some kind of genius. Found this guy through a Facebook group who seemed legit. He had cash, I had time. We pooled $20k (mostly his money tbh) and went all in on garden tools.\n\nOur \"strategy\" was basically throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. Got lucky with one product that just took off. Nothing fancy - cheap tools from Alibaba with our brand slapped on. But man, when it hit, it HIT. Peak month was $800k revenue.\n\nThat month was insane. I literally didn't sleep. Customer emails at 3am, inventory nightmares, ads breaking every other day. My partner handled the boring spreadsheet stuff while I lived in the ad dashboard. Had this one campaign pulling 4.02 ROAS and I thought we were untouchable.\n\nThen Amazon just... deleted us. No joke.\n\nWoke up one morning and everything was gone. Account suspended, listings nuked, support giving me copy-paste responses about \"policy violations.\" Took weeks to figure out someone filed a patent claim. Patent that apparently existed for years but nobody gave a damn until we started making real money.\n\nBeing from Ukraine didn't help either. Whole operation ran through my personal account because we were dumb and didn't know better. Brand registry, everything - all in my name. Worked great until it didn't.\n\nLosing the money sucked but honestly? The worst part was losing the routine. When you're grinding 16 hour days for years and then suddenly... nothing. Just silence. Felt like my brain didn't know what to do with itself.\n\nBeen trying to rebuild since then. Same niche because I'm stubborn like that. Got the LLC, lawyers, all the boring legal stuff sorted this time. Moving slower, being smarter. Or trying to be anyway.\n\nNot selling anything here, just needed to get this off my chest. Anyone else had their business vanish overnight? It's a weird kind of grief. One day you're planning world domination, next day you're staring at empty dashboards wondering wtf happened.\n\nDMs open if anyone wants to commiserate or whatever.

About a year ago, I launched my first app. I had poured everything into it — months of work, late nights, a lot of hope. I was excited. Launch day came... and nothing happened.\n\nLiterally 0 sales.  \nThat kind of silence hits hard when you've been dreaming big. I started questioning everything — my idea, my skills, even if I should keep building.\n\nStill, I couldn’t let go. So I gave it another shot with a second app — this time, it actually started working. People found value in it. I had paying users, recurring revenue, things were finally clicking.\n\nThen… I faced an unexpected setback and had to rebuild everything from scratch.\n\nI’ll admit, that broke me for a bit. But something about starting over again felt different this time. I realized I wasn’t building for the money or the market anymore — I wanted to solve *my* own problem.\n\nI’d always struggled with consistency. Whether it was health, productivity, or side projects — I started strong, but dropped off after a few days or weeks.  \nSo I built a small app to help me stay consistent. Something that would turn a big goal into a personalized daily plan, remind me at the right time, and keep me on track.\n\nI made it just for myself.\n\nBut it worked.  \nFor the first time, I didn’t quit halfway.\n\nSo I decided to put it out there — it’s now called **Luminario**, and it just launched on the App Store (after rebuilding everything under a new account from scratch). I’m not chasing vanity metrics anymore. I just want to help people like me stay on track.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt crushed by failure or burned out by rebuilding… I get it. I’ve been there — more than once.  \nBut starting again might lead to something better than you planned.\n\nHappy to share what I’ve learned if it helps — and would love to hear your story too.",

The good thing is that this place already has good posts and people, so I wouldn't need to do much.\n\n# So, what's next?\n\nLet me ask you all, what do YOU want? **Do you have any suggestions for some improvements?** Or do you think everything's perfect and it just needs a little bit of moderation?\n\nI'm thinking of some events we can organize like AMAs with famous indie hackers, or online meetups of us where we can talk, share and solve each other's problems.\n\nBut **let me your ideas in the comments**, I will be actively reading and replying to all of your comments.\n\nLet's make this community better together!\n\nThanks for reading, Take care <3\n\n[r\\/indiehackers banner](https://preview.redd.it/eauu8762o8ud1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=792efbbd02b3ccd39297500e60608b193c1217a7)",

My monthly costs to run a SaaS as a solo founder Everyone’s talking about Supabase, Vercel, Replit, etc. As the go-to stack for launching SaaS fast.\n\nSo I looked into it for my own app… and quickly realized: **it adds up fast** and gets expensive.\n\nI wanted something lean, reliable, and scalable without burning cash so early (especially without any real users yet)\n\nSo here’s the approach with [Odichat](https://odichat.app), my SaaS product, with a setup that costs me **$45/month** — and it powers:\n\n\\- A production-ready Rails 8 app  \n\\- A staging environment  \n\\- File storage  \n\\- Transactional emails  \n\\- Background jobs  \n\\- Websockets\n\nHere’s the full breakdown:\n\n\\- Hetzner dedicated vCPU (production): $13.49  \n\\- Hetzner shared vCPU (Docker Remote Builder): $4.99 (optional, used for asset precompilation & web app deployments to different envs)  \n\\- Hetzner shared vCPU (staging): $4.99 (optional when starting out, but I already have a few users, so pushing straight to prod isn’t appealing anymore)  \n\\- DigitalOcean Spaces (file storage): $5.33  \n\\- Zoho Mail inbox (support inbox): $1  \n\\- Postmark (email delivery): $15 (I could probably cut this down too)\n\n**Total: $45/month**\n\nI’m using **SQLite3** for the database. It’s completely free and works perfectly fine. I haven't felt the need to migrate over to a PostgreSQL database\n\nFor caching, background jobs, and WebSockets, I’m using the **Rails 8 trifecta**: Solid Cache, Solid Queue, and Solid Cable. It comes built-in by default.\n\nSo, as you can see:\n\nIt’s not serverless and it's not trendy… (Rails is dead, right?)\n\nBut it works great, and gives me a lot of flexibility for very cheap. And I like that.\n\n**What are you guys using, and how much are you spending to run your apps?**",

We've known since Kant and Hare that morality is largely a question of logic and universalizability, multiplied by a huge number of facts, which makes it a problem of computation. \n\nBut we're also told that computing machines that understand morality have no reason -- no volition -- to behave in accordance with moral requirements, because they lack emotions.\n\nIn [The Coherence Imperative](https://www.real-morality.com/the-coherence-imperative), I argue that all minds seek coherence in order to make sense of the world. And artificial minds -- without physical senses or emotions -- need coherence even more. \n\nThe proposal is that the need for coherence creates its own kind of volitions, including moral imperatives, and you don't need emotions to be moral; sustained coherence will generate it. In humans, of course, emotions are also a moral hindrance; perhaps doing more harm than good.\n\nThe implications for AI alignment would be significant. I'd love to hear from any alignment people.\n\nTL;DR: \n\n• Minds require coherence to function\n\n• Coherence creates moral structure whether or not feelings are involved\n\n• The most trustworthy AIs may be the ones that aren’t “aligned” in the traditional sense—but are whole, self-consistent, and internally principled\n\n[https://www.real-morality.com/the-coherence-imperative](https://www.real-morality.com/the-coherence-imperative)",

It's designed to handle large memory snapshots smoothly, providing an efficient way to analyze memory usage in PyTorch models.\n\n**Features:**\n\n* **Faster:** Smoothly display large memory snapshots without the performance issues found in official snapshot viewer https://docs.pytorch.org/memory_viz.\n* **UI:** Use WASD keys and mouse scroll to navigate through the memory timeline. Left-click on any allocation to view its size, call stack, and more; Right-click\n* **Preprocessing:** Convert your PyTorch memory snapshots to a zipped json format using the provided `parse_dump.py` script.\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n1. **Record a Memory Snapshot:** Follow PyTorch's [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/memory_viz.html) to record a memory snapshot of your model.\n2. **Preprocess the Snapshot:** Use the `parse_dump.py` script to convert the snapshot to a zip format:\n\n   ```bash\n   python parse_dump.py -p snapshots/large/transformer.pickle -o ./dumpjson -d 0 -z\n   ```\n3. **Run SnapViewer:** Use Cargo to run the application. \n\n    ```bash\n    cargo run -r -- -z your_dump_zipped.zip --res 2400 1080 \n    ```\n    Note: The CLI options `-z` and `-j` are mutually exclusive.\n\n**Why SnapViewer?**\n\nPyTorch's official web memory visualizer struggles with large snapshots, with a framerate of 2~3 frames per minute (yes, minute). SnapViewer aims to be faster, at least fast enough to do analyses. Currently on my RTX3050 it runs responsive (>30fps) on hundred-MB level snapshots.\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any issues you encounter. Contributions are also welcome!\n\nCheck it out here: [https://github.com/Da1sypetals/SnapViewer](https://github.com/Da1sypetals/SnapViewer)",

I'm using CodeLlama for text-to-code (java) with repository context. I've tried using vector database to retrieve \"potentially relating\" code context but it's a hit or miss. In another experiment, I also tried RL (with LoRA) thinking this might encourage the LLM to generate more syntactically correct codes and avoid making mistakes (give bonus when the code passes compiler checking, penalty when LLM's response doesn't follow a specified template or fails at compilation time). The longer the training goes, the more answers obey the template than when not using RL. However, I see a decline in the code's semantical quality (e.g: same task question, in 1st, 2nd training loop, the generated code can handle edge cases, which is good; in 3rd loop, the code doesn't include such step anymore; in 4th loop, the output contain only code-comment marks).\n\nAfter the experiments, it's apparent to me that I can't just arbitrary RL tuning the model. Why I wanted to use RL in the first place was that when the model makes a mistake, I would inform it of the error and ask it to recover from such mistake. So keeping a history of wrongly recovered generation in the prompt would be too much.\n\nHas there been a universal method to do proper continual training? I appreciate all of your comments!!!",

Additionally, with this method it straightforward to set up local server\n\nAlso for some reason, so many alternatives requires the stupid login at the beginning..\n\nAre there any modern alternatives I should consider? Ideally, I am looking for a lightweight package with easy local instance setup",

Marketing is the hard part.\nAnd you can’t market 10 things at once. especially not as a solo dev. Each product needs attention, distribution, iteration, customer support. You don’t have the bandwidth for that across a graveyard of $9/month microtools.\n\nThey say they’re building “bets.”\nBut most of these bets don’t get a second week of effort. Just a launch tweet, a Product Hunt post, and a Stripe screenshot for clout. Then it’s on to the next.\n\nIt’s not a startup strategy. It’s a content strategy.\nThe product isn’t the app. The product is the thread about the app.\n\nWe’ve reached a point where people build landing pages just to screenshot the Stripe dashboard and pretend it’s validation. $17 MRR and 143 likes later, it’s called a win.\n\nMeanwhile, no one’s sticking with anything long enough to see if it actually works.\n\nYou want to build real leverage?\nPick something, go deep, and deal with the boring stuff:\n\n- Customer support\n- Churn\n- Pricing\n- Positioning\n- Talking to users when you’re not in the mood\n\nThat’s where actual businesses are made. Not in this ADHD sprint to launch the 42nd social media scheduling app\n\nOn my end, I’m just building [glazed.ai](https://glazed.ai). No threadstorms. Just shipping and staying focused.\n\nBuild in public if you want. Launch fast if you want. Make a startup about launching fast if you want.\nBut stop acting like building 100 half-finished projects is some master plan. It’s not brave. It’s not smart. It’s just noise.",

Revenue will follow.\n\n**All nonsense.**\n\nHere's what actually happens:\n\n* **You chase dopamine, not dollars** You get likes, comments, maybe a blue check retweet. Now you're hooked on fake validation. You start working for claps, not customers.\n* **You forget what actually matters** Instead of writing code or closing a deal, you're busy crafting a post about your tech stack. It feels productive. It's not.\n* **You enter the founder echo chamber** Other indie hackers cheering you on doesn't mean you're solving a real problem. They aren't your customers. They can't pay you.\n* **You give away your playbook** Your CAC, your roadmap, your feature plans. Every post helps your competitors copy or counter you faster.\n* **You confuse engagement with traction** Likes aren't revenue. Followers aren't customers. Retweets aren't product-market fit.\n* **You waste a ridiculous amount of time** Writing posts, designing visuals, replying to comments... it adds up to hours every week. That time could be used for fixing bugs or talking to actual users.\n* **You attract the \"advice avalanche\"** Suddenly everyone is an expert. Hot takes, growth hacks, recycled advice. 99% of it is noise from people who haven't built anything in years.\n* **You turn Stripe into content** Posting \"$1k MRR\" screenshots is just the startup version of gym selfies. Your customers don’t care. Ship value, not screenshots.\n* **You create invisible pressure** You feel like you always need to post. Always need to show progress. This leads to rushed features, fake momentum, and eventual burnout.\n* **You get market-blind** Your tweets get likes, so you assume the product is working. It’s not. Likes don't mean you’re solving a real problem.\n\nHere's what you should do instead:\n\n* **Build in private. Sell in public.**\n* **Share results, not the process.** Nobody cares how the sausage gets made.\n* **Hang out where your customers are.** Not where other founders like to lurk.\n\nBuild for your users.  \nNot Twitter.  \nNot Indie Hackers.  \nNot Reddit.  \nNot your ego.\n\nThe best founders I know aren't building in public.  \nThey're building in focus. Quietly. Ruthlessly.\n\n**Here's my site:** [https://efficiencyhub.org/](https://efficiencyhub.org/)  \nI built it, then talked about it.

Hello everyone!\n\nI wanted to share with you a milestone that feels absolutely massive to me. I’m finally making money with SaaS!\n\nThe tool I made is called WaitlistNow and it’s a simple no-code tool to help founders validate their SAAS ideas. It also has built in analytics for the user and automates the whole process of building a waitlist.\n\nIt’s my 5th project since starting this SAAS/software thing 1.2 years ago. For 1.2 years I’ve showed up daily on Reddit, building side projects whenever I have free time, and never made any money. But a voice in my head kept telling me “one day it will happen”.\n\nOnce I had completed what I had defined as MVP, I started cold Dming others and leaving a link to it in comments here and there. Not really thinking much of it.\n\nThen the other night(a few weeks ago) I was relaxing on the couch, watching tv, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone from stripe: “Your First Sale!”. Damn I was so excited. Unreal feeling.\n\nNot life changing money, but it’s the most motivating thing that’s happened to me in a long time. If you’re grinding on something, please just keep going, that first sale is out there.\n\nAfter that sale, with the momentum I got, I was able to slowly scale to get up to 12 sales and a bunch of feedback. Although it may not seem like a lot to some people it’s amazing to me.\n\nIf you want to see what I made, here it is: https://www.waitlistsnow.com",

I'm basically confused about what's inside the gap. Does this imply that an assignment that violates (say) percentage gamma/2 of the clauses is an NP witness. It seems like yes because such an assignment should be NP-complete to find. If so, how would you verify such a proof with 100% accuracy because what if one of the randomly checked clauses is one of the violated clauses. Would finding such an assignment guarantee that there is a satisfying assignment (because it's not the case that no assignment violates less than gamma clauses). I'm confident I must be misunderstanding something but I can’t tell what exactly and any discussion would be appreciated. Thanks!",

My gripe is this completely shuts down a small group of students from spontaneously deciding they would like to play together, as they have no space, despite the large amount of unused space in the school.\n\nI'd like to propose to the administration that all students have access to all rooms, but will have this privilege revoked if they do not have a reservation. But, we make gaining a reservation instant if the room is open, through an app that everyone can download on their phone. Ideally the app would allow students to view different room's open and reserved times, and to make their own reservations on unreserved rooms. Also, if the app could allow administrators to overwrite students reservations, but not vice-versa.\n\nTo be clear, the app does not need to handle locking/unlocking doors, the reservation would simply appear on the app, and students in a room without a reservation, or staying over into another ensemble's reservation would mean the loss of the privilege.\n\nIf anyone knows a software that has these capabilities, I'd love to know!",

GPL source code must be provided if the software is distributed, e.g., via download, sale (yes, that's possible – \"free\" doesn't mean \"gratis\").\n2. Changes must also be under the GPL.\n3. No one may add conditions that restrict the GPL.\n4. You must adopt the GPL's disclaimer of warranty.\n\nHowever, there is no distribution obligation for purely internal use.\n\nIf GPL software is only used over a network, for example, as SaaS, the changes do not have to be published. Why? Because it's considered internal use.\n\nThis means someone could take your GPL software, modify it, and sell it as a service without distributing their changes.\n\nThe Affero GPL, or AGPL for short, closes this loophole.\n\n**Changes to AGPL source code must be distributed even if the software is only used over a network. Even on an intranet!**\n\nThat's why I usually release my open-source software under the AGPL 3.0. If a company wants to use and modify my software online without publishing the changes, they can acquire a different license from me. This is called **dual licensing**.\n\n**Clarifying Open-Source Misconceptions**\n\nYou don't necessarily have to make the modified GPL source code publicly available on GitHub or another platform. It's sufficient if you make the changes available to the users/customers who interact with the software over the network.\n\nIn one sentence: **The (A)GPL ensures that granted freedoms are maintained.**\n\nI think that's brilliant!\n\nCompanies that want to enrich themselves from the work of others without giving anything back naturally find this annoying. That's why there's often whining about \"viral licenses,\" \"too many restrictions,\" \"obstacles,\" and so on.\n\nWhat do you think about this?  \nWhich License you prefer and why?\n\nEdit: Remove wrong example",

Quick rundown of my client sources:\nGot all my clients so far from Indian startup subreddits. The only issue being that Indian clients, especially at the startup stages are less paying than the normal market standards. My first ever client which I got from an Indian startup subreddit was for a meagre 25 USD. I'm not complaining as I had only 2-3 sites on my portfolio at that time, and he did give me referral to a client from which I charged around 40 USD. These offered me a good stepping stones for my next client (charged around 95 usd) and now I'm charging over 100 dollars and got immensely better at this thing. But because of my \"high\" rates in the Indian ecosystems, I have very few frequency of the clients coming in and also some do not end up publishing the site because the tech stack that I use i.e Framer, costs monthly plans which are sometimes unaffordable for my clients. I have decided to skip Indian clients and focus on international clients.\nTried Fiverr and Upwork, but the hyper competitive landscape there is killing me. I apply to a job every month on upwork through the monthly free connects that I get, but I manage to get no responses so far. I do think that my portfolio is decent and the websites I make are also pretty decent looking but ofcourse, I strive to make it better and upskill myself. I also tried cold emailing a few companies with their website revamps but got no reply. I also find this process to be unproductive as you're spending your time for revamping someone's website who might not need a revamp for a bunch of reasons, also it's unnecessary expenditure for them as most people think in the terms of \"it's okay as long as it's functioning\" and give lesser regards to design and ux. It's also hard to determine what they actually need or what their vision with the website is without even talking to them. Plus it's also difficult to determine if they would be willing to change their current tech stack.\nI have tried several different ways to find clients but have been unsuccessful in a lot of them so far.\n\nSo how and where do I actually find clients?",

Patients miss appointments, get lost, or delay care simply because they don’t know where to go. At the same time, hospital staff lose valuable time giving directions, managing confused patients, or dealing with bottlenecks at key entrances and desks.\n\nWhat STRIDE Does:\n\t\n1. Patients get step-by-step directions from entrance to their specific clinic, imaging department, or patient room\n\n2. Optional layers for accessibility routing, multi-language support, or low-stimulation pathways (neurodiverse-friendly)\n\t\n3. Integrated mobile check-in and appointment reminders\n\n4. Wait time display and movement tracking for improved flow\n\n5. Self-service backend: hospital uploads floor plan, tags key destinations, and STRIDE handles the rest\n\nFor Hospitals:\n\nReduces missed or delayed appointments. Cuts front-desk time spent on giving directions. Improves Press Ganey/patient satisfaction scores. Works as a layer on top of their existing systems, no deep rebuilds required. Scales easily across multiple buildings or locations\n\nDifferentiation:\n\nMost players in this space are:\n\t•\tEnterprise-only\n\t•\tFocused on IT leaders\n\t•\tComplex and slow to deploy\n\t•\tBuilt for desktops or kiosks, not phones\n\nSTRIDE is different  because it’s clean, mobile-first, and designed to be implemented fast, especially for hospitals that don’t have a million-dollar IT budget.\n\nMy Ask:\n\n1. If you work in health tech, operations, or patient experience, does this solve a real problem?\n\n2.\tIf you’ve been a lost patient or had a parent stuck trying to find the right department, would something like this help?\n\t\n3. Is there a red flag I’m missing?\n\t\n4. Would love intros to hospital administrators, outpatient clinics, or anyone building tech in this space.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts and happy to go deeper if there’s interest.",

Since she helped me so much, I’d love to pass on these insights to help other beginners or even experienced designers, grow faster.\n\nTL;DR – Some of the most helpful recommendations she gave me include:\n\n* Typographica’s Independent Type Foundry Reviews\n* FlowClub\n* Rosart Project (KABK MA Revival Project)\n* Future Fonts\n* The Pyte Foundry\n* Type Design Resources GitHub Repo\n* Fontstand\n* TYPODARIUM (Print Calendar)\n* Velvetyne Type Foundry\n* Open Foundry\n* Tiro Typeworks Articles & Notes\n* Counterpunch by Fred Smeijers\n\nI won’t go into detail on each one here to keep this post short, but overall, these are some real gems, a wonderful list for learning and growth, especially for those in UI design or anyone looking to explore the full potential of user experience, whether for personal projects or professional work.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of some of these or want to know more about any of them, feel free to ask in the comments I’m happy to share more in my own words.

These new APIs are available for you to integrate with starting today, and will start returning data in 90 days. We will share more details about this change and the exact timing in a subsequent update. \n\n**What are Reddit announcements**\n\nAnnouncements are non-repliable Reddit-official messages that are currently sent as private messages. This includes:\n\n* Updates about Reddit policies and settings\n* Communications about account and content status\n* Marketing updates about products or events\n\nThe announcement APIs can be used to receive and read notifications sent from Reddit. \n\n**How announcements work**\n\nAnnouncements will appear as notifications in the notifications section of the inbox (i.e. the bell icon) on the native Reddit apps. When selected, these messages will be expandable to view in their entirety. \n\n**Why are we making this change?**\n\nWe want to make it easier for users to distinguish between non-repliable messages and official updates they receive from Reddit, from repliable messages they receive from other users, subreddits, and bots on the platform. \n\n**Migrating your apps**\n\nDevelopers should update their integrations within 90 days. If changes aren’t made within this time frame, nothing will break, but your app will not receive Reddit announcements and may miss critical communications.

    "chunk_text": "[Policy Question] Does my Reddit data migration tool comply with API terms? Need guidance on cookie-based authentication I've built an open-source tool called Reddit-Migrate that helps users transfer their data between Reddit accounts, and I want to make sure I'm fully compliant with Reddit's API terms and policies before promoting it further.\n\n# What the Tool Does\n\n**Reddit-Migrate** allows users to transfer:\n\n* Subreddit subscriptions\n* Saved posts\n* Followed users\n\nFrom one Reddit account to another, running entirely locally on the user's machine.\n\n# Technical Implementation Details\n\n**Authentication Method:**\n\n* Uses cookie-based authentication (user provides their own Reddit cookies)\n* No OAuth app registration required from users\n* Cookies are processed locally - never sent to external servers\n\n**API Usage:**\n\n* Uses official Reddit API endpoints:\n   * `/api/me.json` for account verification\n   * `/subreddits/mine/subscriber` for fetching subscriptions\n   * `/api/subscribe` for subscribing to subreddits\n   * `/user/{username}/saved` for saved posts\n   * `/api/save` for saving posts\n   * Similar endpoints for user follows\n\n**Rate Limiting:**\n\n* Implements delays between API calls to respect rate limits\n* Batches requests where possible (e.g., 100 subreddits per batch)\n* Large migrations can take several minutes due to conservative rate limiting\n\n**Privacy/Security:**\n\n* Tool runs on localhost:5005\n* All data processing happens locally\n* No external servers involved\n* User cookies never leave their machine\n\n# Specific Policy Questions\n\n1. **Cookie Authentication**: Is using user-provided cookies for API access compliant? The tool doesn't store or transmit these cookies anywhere.\n2. **Bulk Operations**: Does transferring hundreds of saved posts/subscriptions violate any bulk usage policies, even with rate limiting?\n3. **Account Migration Use Case**: Is helping users migrate their own data between their own accounts an acceptable use case?\n4. **Distribution**: Is it okay to distribute this as open-source software for users to run locally?\n5. **API Terms Compliance**: Are there any specific terms I should be aware of that might affect this use case?\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* Tool is intended for personal use only (users migrating their own data)\n* No commercial use or data collection\n* Respects rate limits and implements delays\n* Users must provide their own cookies (tool doesn't scrape or hack anything)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/nileshnk/reddit-migrate](https://github.com/nileshnk/reddit-migrate)\n\nI've read through the [API Terms](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and [Developer Terms](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms), but I'd appreciate guidance from the community on whether this implementation raises any red flags.\n\n**Main concern**: I want to ensure the cookie-based authentication approach and bulk migration functionality don't inadvertently violate any policies.\n\nThanks for any insights! Happy to provide more technical details if needed.\n\n**TL;DR**: Built a local tool that uses Reddit cookies to migrate user data between accounts. Want to confirm it's policy-compliant before wider release.",

I am trying to build a Reddit commenter bot that'd post comments on those subreddits which match with the content of my blogs. Earlier, I had tried generating comments using Open AI but that didn't work and my account was suspended. :/ So I had tried commenting on my own to one of the sub reddit posts and as soon as I tried commenting manually the 3rd time in a span of 10 min, my account got suspended again. I guess this might be a shadow ban (temporarily).\n\nI'm using PRAW API wrapper and in User-Agent headers, I am explicitly providing a meaningful description for it.\n\nHere's the snippet:\n\n    client_id = os.getenv('REDDIT\\_CLIENT\\_ID')  \n    client_secret = os.getenv('REDDIT\\_CLIENT\\_SECRET')  \n    username = os.getenv('REDDIT\\_USERNAME')  \n    password = os.getenv('REDDIT\\_PASSWORD')  \n    user_agent = 'CommentBot/1.0 (by )'.                                 \n\nStill my account is getting suspended.

A domain/keyword to ban, an improvement to the bot, or anything? Just leave a comment below or PM me [(click HERE to PM me)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=firemylasers)!**\n\nOkay, time for a little update. I'm not that interested in this project these days, and I'm too busy with university to care about tech news. I have done nothing to the bot in quite some time beyond a minor filter list update. For the time being, this will probably continue. (The source code is also a bit hard to understand at this point, it's not the most elegantly written bot and I threw together features and patches a bit haphazardly). If you have a proposed feature addition, have noticed a problem (such as the bot stopping posting), or want me to blacklist another keyword/domain, please PM me. I'll keep this bot/subreddit active indefinitely, the VPS it's on is needed for other stuff and the bot is completely automatic (it also hasn't broken in quite some time), but I won't be actively improving it. I'm not sure how many people actually find this to be a useful alternative to /r/technology, but based on voting patterns, traffic, and subreddit subscriptions, it does seem that there are at least some people out there who find it useful, so I won't be shutting this down or anything. Just be aware that I am not currently working on this project and if there's an issue you will need to bring it to my attention for it to get fixed.\n\nAnother little update (2/5/2015): I'm even more busy with university these days. I've updated the submission stats below (close to 72k URLs submitted in the past year and a half!). The bot seems to be running fine with zero monitoring, and subreddit traffic has held fairly steady every month since the last big drop around July 2014. The log file is a bit massive, but I've got plenty of spare disk space. I still have no plans to update the bot, and while I'm not quite happy with the current filters, I don't think there are any obvious improvements that I could make. The traffic counts seem to indicate that this subreddit is still useful, which is excellent. If anyone has any ideas for keywords to block/restrict (or domains), feel free to PM me.\n\n##News\n\n[News prior to 4/29/14 can be found in the old version of this thread (click here to view it).](http://www.reddit.com/r/realtech/comments/1kjduq/subreddit_news_proposed_domainkeyword_bans/)\n\n* On July 29th, the bot was down for around eight hours due to what seems to be an unannounced change in reddit's API. I didn't notice the issue until the bot had been down for six hours, and it took me quite a while to figure out exactly what the issue was and how to fix it. Anyways, the bot is back up now, sorry about that.\n\n* It looks like the content in both /r/technology and /r/realtech has been going downhill recently. I've tweaked the filters a bit, which should hopefully improve things.\n\n##Rough development ideas\n\n* Tweak the flood limit to eliminate post flooding after bot downtime.\n\n* Consider a tag system. I could either tag with the original usernames, or with a bot-guessed topic.\n\n##Stats\n\n*Last updated 04/09/15*\n\nTotal unique URLs submitted: 80743\n\nTop 20 domains (with submission counts):\n\n    2850 arstechnica.com\n    2805 www.theverge.com\n    2479 techcrunch.com\n    1778 www.engadget.com\n    1675 www.wired.com\n    1293 www.theguardian.com\n    1212 www.nytimes.com\n    1153 www.bbc.co.uk\n    1140 www.businessinsider.com\n     963 mashable.com\n     898 www.washingtonpost.com\n     858 www.reuters.com\n     817 www.cnet.com\n     816 www.zdnet.com\n     795 www.forbes.com\n     759 gigaom.com\n     703 www.bbc.com\n     703 phys.org\n     700 thenextweb.com\n     633 www.techdirt.com\n\n\n##Information\n\nAladdin was written in Ruby.
