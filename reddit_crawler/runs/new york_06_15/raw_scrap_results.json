There's no reason a uniformed law enforcement officer should be allowed to withhold his/her identifying information during a lawful arrest or detention. The guy in the photo (the agent, not the victim) is a freaking prototype of the kind of person who becomes an ICE agent. Noem is ordering her gestapo to dig up something on this guy as we speak.

There’s no need to prolong someone’s suffering if they don’t want to go through it. \n\nI’m annoyed by the Catholic lobbyists for attempting to block the bill. Why should your religious beliefs dictate how someone else handles their own terminal illness? Dr. Kevorkian was always right here. Anyone who has ever been at the end of someone's life with a terminal illness knows this is just humane. My uncle chose this route last year (in Canada). I am so happy for him and my aunt that he was able to go on his own terms. He had very advanced Parkinson’s and his quality of had been bad for years. \n\nHe died at home in his favorite chair, looking through a window to the lake.\n\nI’m proud of our legislators for passing this, and hope the Governor signs it. The New York state Senate on Monday night voted to pass the Medical Aid in Dying Act just days before the end of its legislative session on June 12.\n\nThe measure passed shortly before 9 p.m. by a margin of 35-27 following a debate that lasted two hours. The historic vote occurred over a month and a half after [the Assembly passed the Medical Aid in Dying Act on April 23](https://www.silive.com/news/2025/04/ny-assembly-votes-in-favor-of-medical-aid-in-dying.html) by a margin of 81-67, narrowly surpassing the threshold of 75 votes.\n\n“Since the first day that I began advocating for the MAID Act, I have made it clear that this legislation is about honoring a terminally ill person’s choice to make their own end-of-life decisions,” Staten Island Sen. Jessica Scarcella-Spanton told the Advance/SILive.com, referencing a commonly used acronym for the Medical Aid in Dying Act. “This is about giving people the compassion and dignity that they deserve, the importance of which I have witnessed firsthand while meeting with many of the advocates for this legislation, many of whom were or are suffering from a terminal illness.\"\n\nThe bill now heads to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s desk. It’s not immediately clear whether the governor, a Democrat, will sign it. When reached for comment late Monday night, a spokesperson for Gov. Hochul told the Advance/SILive.com the governor “will review the legislation.”\n\nAccording to state law, if a bill is sent to the governor while the legislature is in session, she has 10 days — not including Sundays — to sign or veto it. Failure to sign a bill within that 10-day period would mean a bill becomes law automatically. If a bill is sent to the governor when the legislature is out of session, she has 30 days to make a decision. A failure to act has the same effect as a veto.\n\nShould she sign the bill, New York would become the 13th jurisdiction in the United States to permit medical aid in dying, following Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, Delaware, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, New Jersey, Maine and New Mexico. They passed it at a reasonable hour Monday night, on its own, which lowers the likelihood of there being half-a-mil for some committee chairman’s cousin’s company snuck in there.",

(I got this from a podcast, TWIV) I’d like to share a letter I’ve sent to the governors of the seven Democrat-led states with the largest GDPs. (CA, NY, PA, IL, WA, NJ, MA) They may not have political power, but they have fiscal power, and need to use it.\n\n“Dear Governor,\n\nYou belong to a group that can save the world—the Magnificent Seven. You lead one of seven Democratic states that together account for 38% of U.S. GDP—the third largest economy in the world.\n\nOf all the Trump administration’s destructive attacks, its impounding of 40%, $20 billion, of NIH funding is the worst. NIH is the linchpin of U.S. scientific leadership. The Magnificent Seven can save critical scientific research, by backfilling 38% of this lost funding.\n\nIf each state in the Magnificent Seven increases taxes by 1.86% on incomes of at least $1 million, together that will account for the 38%.\n\nThe administration’s impoundment is illegal. States can claw back the funding they provide. This is important: any recovered funding will be returned to the wealthy taxpayers.\n\nBy acting in unison, states will make a difference. Their common action makes sacrifice shared. It mutes each state’s right-wing attacks. By ensuring taxes will be returned if funds are restored, the wealthy will seek to have NIH funding restored.\n\nEvery state has its own problems politicians want to increase funding for. But their constituents are concerned about national issues. They will understand a temporary tax paid by people with incomes of at least $1 million is for science across America.\n\nThere are over 400,000 people with incomes of at least $1 million in the seven states. That’s well over half of all such people in America. All of the seven can enact this tax, even California, where Democrats have the 2/3 majorities needed.\n\nRise to the challenge, and join in a Magnificent Seven states that demonstrate Democrats can act aggressively and imaginatively. Triage will be necessary, since 38% of funding is restored. But this is enough to maintain scientific momentum.\n\nThank you for your dedicated service and thoughtful heroism.",

    "chunk_text": "Recommendations where to live Me and my family are from Indiana. We are currently researching places to live and some have recommended upstate NY because of the similar cost of living. As well as having people overall that are like minded. I’m pretty fed up with Indiana as the state continues to move backwards. Any cities/towns upstate anybody could recommend?\n\nEDIT: For more context, I am in an interracial marriage. I’m white, she is South Asian. We have a 14 month old son together. I am a chef and she is a lab technician for a company contracted through the electric company in our region. I can always get a job transfer as I work for a large company with many brands under their name. I’d like for my son to go to school where there is diversity and kids like him. We will not get that here in Indiana. Cost of living in this state is okay but overall it’s becoming not worth it. Hey fellow Hoosier! My sister and I moved to Rochester in December for similar reasons. We just couldn’t take the casual racism, bigotry, and gleeful ignorance anymore and after Braun won, I knew it would get worse. We’re also biracial white/asian. \n\nOverall so far we like it here a lot. I’m from the Fort Wayne area and I feel like cost of living and the climate are pretty similar, maybe a bit cooler and winter a bit longer, but I don’t mind it. Spring was gorgeous. Lots of public parks and trails. We both work from home and are complete homebodies so we haven’t really interacted with people here much, but almost everyone I’ve met so far has been really kind. The neighborhood I live in is very diverse. Job market can be tough, but there are lots of healthcare jobs around here. Minimum wage is much higher, which bumps up a lot of the other jobs too. Rising rents are a concern. The city definitely has its problems and there are hateful people everywhere, but overall I feel like people here are trying to make things better rather than going backwards. \n\nI hear Buffalo is similar, but I haven’t spent much time there yet. I haven’t gone elsewhere in the state much either. If you can, I recommend coming and visiting a few places first. Check out the vibes, see if there are communities you’d get along with, check out rental/housing costs, job availability, etc. What is more important, low cost of living or a more progressive mindset? You can find either in NY, but getting both is tough.\n\n\nHow do you feel about snow forecasts measured in feet?\n\n\nDo you have kids/will they attend the public schools?\n\n\nDoes anyone in the family work in a specific industry?\n\n\nAny hobbies? First of all, welcome :)\n\nThere are definitely pockets of blue and purple upstate, in the southern tier, and in western NY. The easiest way to find good targets is to take a look at where SUNY colleges are based and work out from there.\n\nAlbany and surrounding areas might be a good fit for you, even suburbs up through Saratoga. You'd be about the same distance to NYC as you currently are to STL. As for baseball, aside from our two MLB teams, you'd have the Hudson Valley Renegades, who play in Fishkill. They're the high-A Yankee affiliate - the park is really nice.\n\nPlenty of excellent hiking/fishing/nature to enjoy nearby. I know the Buffalo area including Buffalo itself has sizable Indian and Bangladeshi communities. It's also day trip distance to the Toronto area where there is a massive South Asian community.\n\nI don't know if it's similar cost of living, but the Buffalo area isn't usually considered high cost of living. Buffalo or Albany, suburbs. Both have active subreddits. I'm in albany, we have family in buffalo. Im happy to answer questions about either.",

Wasn't there something like this in canal a few years back? Like males in 20- 30s ended up in the canal?   Sad way to go for the girl, going after her phone and drowning. \n\nAlso, this just reinforces why I get grossed out when I see people fishing in the river around Manhattan, you seriously gonna eat that fish???

My husband and I are from Washington State and we are traveling to a wedding south of Buffalo next year, and we would like start planning a fun east coast visit, while we are over on the New England side of the country, some cute cozy small towns. I'm thinking Nancy Meyers: hydrangeas, small cute coffee shops, small town fun things to do, antique shops, etc.\n\nMaybe even Stars Hollow vibes for those who watch Gilmore Girls.\n\nWe will be renting a car and we'd be willing to drive for a few hours if it's worth it! I appreciate the suggestions! The Finger Lakes region is not far south of Buffalo. Whole region is nice. Just be mindful Buffalo to anywhere in New England is a minimum five hour drive. The closest cute New England town would be Williamstown MA. Cute town, cute college, three great museums, good homes. That would be 5 hour straight shot on highway. East Aurora, a small village just south of Buffalo, has been the filming location for a few Hallmark movies.\n\nETA: a Hallmark movie is actually being filmed there right now Gilmore Girls takes place in Litchfield County in Connecticut, and basically every town in that area fits the description of what you're looking for. It's a long drive from Buffalo (about 6 hours), but if you're looking for Stars Hollow, you might as well go right to the source. New York is not in New England, that is all I will say.",

I can easily hit 20 mph on level terrain without any electric assist, and I'm a mediocre biker.\n\nReducing pedal assist on Citibike e bikes may not be a bad idea. Way too many people going really fast without helmets. But if the max assist is already only 18 mph then I don't know if 15 is going to make a difference, and 15 sounds reasonable to me. I've nearly been nailed by both peddle bikes and e-bikes. Both on foot and in a car. The number of reckless bike riders i have seen is disappointing as it makes arguments against them easy to make. Now do cars Wack Eric Adam's cant just legislate momentum away. No matter what you think about bikes vs cars, physics still fucking exists. \n\nAt lower speeds, heavier bikes are harder to control. This is true for motorcycles, e-bikes, scooters and even bicycles. At low speeds, light bikes can stop and make turns much easier. By forcing e-bikes, which are heavier, to go slower, Adam's is actually making it more dangerous to use e-bikes. \n\nI think Adam's and his friends are trying to exacerbate the problem to crack down more. I would not be surprised if Cuomo is also friends with the same people. When this gets more people killed, the blood will be on their hands and these ghouls will not lose a wink of sleep.",
