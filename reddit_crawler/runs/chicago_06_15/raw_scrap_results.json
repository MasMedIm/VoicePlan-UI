It was the best moment of the whole day.¬†\n\nThose women got their day because people fought. This wonderful women gets a better life because of the women that came before us and fought. It‚Äôs so damn poignant today what fighting for others can do.¬†\n\nCongrats to her, and congratulations on being a good sport and rolling with the day. There was an adorable older couple with their luggage walking with the protesters today. Can't imagine checking out of my hotel and walking into a street protest in a strange city but they took it in stride Wife material, for real. PS. If anyone knows who this is, please let me know! I have a couple pics like this I‚Äôd love to send them (sans black eye smudge of course!) That‚Äôs me!! Getting married is no excuse not to protest the fascist regime!\n\nMy bridesmaids made our protest sign while we were getting ready and I was so excited that the march came by us at the right time so that we could be a part of it! Everyone was so lovely and supportive. Someone even let us borrow their Mexican and American flags to take a picture with. It was perfect. \n\nThen our bus was surrounded by the protest and everyone was so lovely and helped as our groomsmen guided us out. \n\nNo one is illegal on stolen land. Fuck ICE and fuck trump. Love trumps hate. Best wedding day ever!!",

I went for a 2.77 mile walk with thousands of you wonderful people There were several routes as the organizers found it difficult to herd a bazillion Chicagoans at first, so yours may have been a little different. But the really neat thing about coming north up Wabash was the moment the you cleared the tracks and Trump's sign on that skyscraper came into view, it really energized the march: The chants were loudest and most passionate at that point and only escalated on the way north to Wacker. Thanks to all who joined. That was my favorite part of the march. Energy dipped a bit under the tracks and then exploded walking up to Wacker. I was marching too. Beautiful day for it and the vibes were right. Everyone brought the right mood for it. Thanks for giving the distance - I was wondering! So proud to have been a part of this and so proud of this city. Love you, Chicago. I was only able to reach Trump tower before needing to leave the area but what a beautiful route.

Maybe 40 to 50 up the sidewalk of Michigan Ave in the Loop. I saw that 'Only Ice We Need' sign when I was there. It's a fun sign, but ironic now considering Ice Cube's right-leaning politics nowadays. No sleep till No Kings So many layers. But this could mean Cube's old music given the age of the photo See you in 11-15 days.",

    "chunk_text": "I'm moving to Chicago next month, and this place is so fuckin cool. I can't wait to be with you guys I've lived in MA my whole life (save 2 years in NH), and decided over the winter to make a change. Chicago seems like the right fit for me, so I took my vacation this week to come out here for job interviews, apartment hunting, and just to check it out.\n\nLet me tell you, this city is cool as fuck, but you alreadyknow that. Don't get me wrong, Boston/MA will always have its place in my heart, and I'll always be a bit of a masshole deep down. But having been here for a few days, even when I'm interviewing/staging, I fuckin love the vibe of this city. The people, the space, the different neighborhoods, how much there is to do, but none of its pretentious .. I dunno, its so much cooler than I could've imagined. Like, in five days I've heard police/ambulance sirens twice? Dead ass you can't go a full minute without hearing them in Boston or NYC. Plus, I've seen the lights for Pride Month, but seeing the passion and community of everyone this weekend just reinforces the idea that everyone's got each other's backs. It's so cool. I cant wait to be here.\n\nJust wanted to thank you guys for making such an awesome place. Not for myself, for everyone. See ya soon ‚úåÔ∏è Welcome!!  Some tips from a Chicagoan who spent about a decade in Boston/MA:\n\nIt gets much less snow here than MA, but WAY more cold.  Expect that people will get bent out of shape over 6+ inches, but you may be expected to tough it out through temperatures below zero.  \n\nThere are more beaches than you'd think.  Don't sleep on the Indiana Dunes.\n\nOur museums really are world class.  If you like the Museum of Science, make sure to trek down to Hyde Park to visit the Museum of Science and Industry.\n\nIf ever you miss gridlock, just drive on I-90 or 290 almost any time of day, lol.  Otherwise, enjoy the grid system!  So nice to be going west and know without a doubt that a mile or two ahead, the road will still be going west.  \n\nThe equivalent of the Duck Boats here is the architecture river tours, and now is a perfect time to go! \n\nRooftop culture is a thing here, and tis the season.  Tons of awesome restaurants to check out.\n\nOur Cape or Martha's Vineyard is Michigan.  Traverse City or Mackinaw are a drive, but very cute!  \n\nWe do say 'ope,' and we don't really say 'I'm all set.'  \n\nThere's a Legal Seafoods in Marina City for when you really miss home. Chicago and Boston are my two favorite places, though I never managed to live in Boston.\n\nWelcome! Welcome! See ya soon!! as a fellow boston expat, aside from the much cheaper cost of living the other plus is all the boston teams are now out of market so you can watch sox/b's/c's on the cheap tier streamers if that's your thing",

    "chunk_text": "Who TF is paying $350 to watch Bulls, Blackhawks and White Sox??? I used to watch our sports team all the time, had such fond memories throughout my life watching the Bulls, Blackhawks and White Sox. I barely watch anymore, and not because I've lost my passion for our sports teams, but rather because I refuse to pay these increasingly ridiculous amounts of money to watch them. I no longer have cable (screw Comcast for many reasons!!!) and when CHSN was over the air for a brief year, it was amazing, I was reconnecting with my teams. Now, Comcast made a deal with CHSN and that channel is no longer available over the air for us in Chicago. No way in hell I'm paying $350 to watch my teams, I think that is nuts given all the revenue sources for sports teams already in place.\n\nWho's actually paying this and thinks it is a good deal? I don't know, I think at the end of the day these moronic executives who think they have these great ideas to drive up revenue are simply just driving away the fan base. I guess I won't be watching any games again unless one of our teams makes the playoffs and they are broadcast over the air again, but even then, I'd be so far out the loop I'm not sure I can really enjoy it like I would have if I could follow them all season. I'd basically just be one of those fake fans, there for the brief moment, and kind of clueless.  They're literally driving me away from my sports teams, and my kids sure won't be following them either because it just isn't available for them like it was for me growing up. This will hit our sports teams in the coming decades with a rapidly declining fan base, it absolutely will, I don't see how it doesn't.  Good luck idiot executives, hope it works out well for you, but it isn't working for your basic sports fan like me, and I'm sure there are many others like me. Hi!
