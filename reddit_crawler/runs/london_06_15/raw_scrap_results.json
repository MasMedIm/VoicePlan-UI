    "chunk_text": "Weekly Q&A Megathread. Please post any questions about visiting, tourism, living, working, budgeting, housing here! # Hello, welcome to London!\n\n*Visiting us?  Moving to study or work?  Brief layover? Moving to a new part of London? Any small questions about life here, if you're new or been here your whole life, this is the place!*\n\nWe get a lot of posts asking very similar questions so this post aims to address some of our most Frequently Asked Questions, and give you a place to ask for assistance.\n\nYour first port of call should be\n\n# [the r/london wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/index)\n\nIt includes sections on:\n\n**What should I see and where are the non-touristy stuff and hidden gems?**  \nWe've written about the big must-sees [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/thingstosee) and we highly recommend [TfL's Experiences site](https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/experience-london).  \nWe've listed some of our favourite lesser-known stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/secretlondon) And the cheap/free stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/lowbudget)\n\n**What's happening in London today/this weekend/this month**? Check out listings: [VisitLondon](http://www.visitlondon.com) \\- London's official tourist website; [Time Out London](https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do) \\- the original and classic listings site; [The Londonist](http://londonist.com/) \\- like a newer Time Out; [IanVisits](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/calendar/) \\- a blog of the more quirky  cultural and historical events; [Skiddle](https://www.skiddle.com/cities/london/) \\- popular site for gigs and club nights; [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/guide/uk/london) \\- the go-to for electronic music and club nights; [NightNomads](https://www.nightnomads.com/events/in/london) \\- nightlife listings site; [London Ears](http://londonears.com/) \\- extensive chronological gig listings with Spotify links; [Designmynight](https://www.designmynight.com/london) \\- curated lists of cool restaurants, quirky bars and various different fun events and experiences; [Galleries Now](https://www.galleriesnow.net/exhibitions/london/) \\- exhibitions at leading galleries and art museums. For recommendations for our favourite venues for music (from classical, to stadium rock, to jazz, to metal, to dance music) plus theatres/shows/live comedy/everything else [check the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/play/).\n\n**How do I pay for the Tube/bus, and what's an Oyster card?**  \nYou don't pay cash.  You can use a number of contactless payments systems such as your Contactless bankcard (which is widespread in the UK, but maybe not so much elsewhere), Apple Pay, Android Pay, or you can buy an Oyster card and top it up with credit.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/gettingaround) for more.\n\n**Where should I live? What's x area like?**  \nHave a look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/living)  \nIt includes recommended sites to find places to live and rent, and has a section on what particular areas are like.\n\n**How do I get from this place to that place?**  \nUse [Citymapper](http://citymapper.com).  Honestly, we're not shills for them; it's just a really good app and is used by most of the locals on this sub.\n\n**Is x area safe?**  \nYes. Bad stuff can happen in any large city, but London is generally very safe.  There aren't any no-go zones, and most Londoners feel safe.  See [our safety page here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/safety) for more.\n\n**Where can I watch the baseball/basketball/football/handegg match?**  \nA comprehensive guide to all London football matches in all leagues can be found at [tlfg.uk](http://www.tlfg.uk). Use [Fanzo](https://www.fanzo.com/en/best-pubs-in-london/3128) to find pubs showing a variety of sports and see our list of other places [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/sport)\n\n**How do I get a UK SIM card for my phone?**  \nAdvice on networks and how to get a SIM card is covered [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/connectivity). If you need suggestions for places to do some remote work/take a call [check the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/remote/).\n\n**Is the London Pass worth it?**  \n[Probably not](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/wiki/londonpass)\n\nOther subs that you may find helpful:\n\n* r/LondonSocialClub \\- Meeting new people for events, activities and/or pints.\n* r/VisitLondon \\- A dedicated tourism sub for holiday-planning questions \n* r/UKtravel \\- For guidance, advice and suggestions for travelling around the rest of the country to/from London\n* r/IWantOut & r/UKvisa \\- Check if you need a visa and how to get one if you want to work here\n* r/LegalAdviceUK \\- Good for all sorts, especially for questions about landlords and contracts\n* r/HousingUK \\- For advice on renting or buying accommodation in the UK\n* r/TenantsInTheUK \\- Specifically to discuss the nitty-gritty, positives and pitfalls of renting\n* r/UKPersonalFinance \\- Another goldmine of sage advice.\n* r/AskUK \\- Great for general questions about UK life that aren't specific to London\n\n**Tips for posting:**\n\n**Tell us about you** \\- If you want us to suggest things for you to do then you need to give us a good idea of what you enjoy. Don't just say \"I like music\", say what type of music. Don't just say you want \"somewhere nice to eat\", say what type of cuisine you like (or don't like). The more specific you are the better, otherwise you'll just get pointed back to the generic guidebooks, blogs and our wiki.\n\n**Tell us your budget** \\- If you're on a budget then tell us what it is and we can bear that in mind when making recommendations. There's no point in us coming up with ideas for things to do and places to eat if they'll clean out your wallet within the first 5 minutes. Saying you want something \"cheap\" isn't really helpful because what's cheap is entirely subjective.\n\n**Tell us where you'll be based** \\- Let us know where you'll be staying so that we can give local recommendations.\n\n**Asking about hotels or hostels** \\- We have homes here so know very little about what the hotels are like. Look on review websites such as TripAdvisor. However, if you say \"I've been looking at these three hotels. Which do you think is the better location?\" then that's the sort of thing we can answer.\n\n**Non-touristy stuff** \\- There are no secret corners where we hide the good stuff from outsiders! This is one of the most written about cities in the world, so when we want to go to a museum, or gallery, go window shopping, or whatever, we look at the same sources as tourists (listings sites, blogs, etc - see front page of the wiki).\n\n^(These weekly posts are scheduled to post each Monday at 00:01. If it's late in the week you may want to wait for a new post to appear. Please send us) [^(ModMail)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flondon) ^(with any suggested improvements!)\n\n**Discord**\nJoin our new [Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/bDNq4a77tX) Are there any pubs which regularly show horse racing?

Thank you! Hello!! I just graduated and am really interested in moving to London for a year or two. I graduated from a uni on the HPI visa list, but I'm also a citizen since my dad is originally from the UK. I wanted to know: how hard is it to get a job in nonprofit sector? How much money should I save up to move? Are there a lot of bartending/restaurant jobs in the city in case I can't immediately get a job in the nonprofit sector? Pls lend me some advice if you can!! Thank you so much :D Does anyone know if you can walk through the Excel centre? The conference is on the Prince Regent DLR station side near the East Entrance, and have been advised to get the DLR along rather than trying to walk from the West entrance. Any thoughts on that appreciated. https://preview.redd.it/ga9lfmhhdq6f1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42e0c397bf1737fdda9adc4562f59a7ef351dcf4\n\nCAMDEN question: Does anyone know what’s going on with this building work on the rail line / overground just by Parkway where it meets Oval Rd? It looks to me like they’re building some kind of station, but I can’t seem to find any information about this.",

    "chunk_text": "Blind girl considering moving from Washington DC to London. Need advice Hi! I’m blind and I’m considering moving to London from Washington DC. I wanted to know how accessible living in London is for blind folks? I have visited London a couple of times and found it a bit overwhelming compared to DC which has a mid sized city vibe and isn’t too overwhelming. My perception of London might be skewed though as I have only experienced it as a tourist. The two concerns/questions I have are: \n\n1) I’m generally not a fan of the tube—in London it seemed impossible to navigate and use the tube independently as a blind person. I prefer buses but London buses seemed inconvenient and travel time on them was much longer. Uber was very expensive. In DC, I live in a very walkable neighborhood so I either walk to places using Aira (it’s a navigation app which I don’t think is available in the UK) or take the uber when I go places on my own. So my question is, how do blind people get around London without spending a fortune on Ubers or taking the tube? \n2) I’m into adaptive sports. Tandem cycling and other adaptive sports like blind dragon boating, kayaking and rock climbing are a big part of my life in DC. I have found a wonderful group for blind athletes here. How’s the adaptive sports scene in London? \n\nAnother option is to live in Oxford which I have visited frequently. It’s much less overwhelming and taking the bus is easy but I didn’t really find places that do adaptive sports there, and generally because the buildings are old there, accessibility in the built environment didn’t seem great. \n\nWould be grateful if anyone could shed some light on living in London independently as a blind person.  Hey. I'm not visually impaired but am a guide for VI sports. \n\nIn terms of the tube, it depends what you mean by using it independently. All frontline Transport for London staff have accessibility training. If you turn up at a staffed station you are entitled to passenger assistance. Standard practice for most of my VI friends is that they arrive and tell a member of staff where they want to go. There's sometimes a short wait (say 5 minutes) and then a member of staff escorts them through the station and on to the train. The staff radio ahead and the VI person is met by another member of staff at their arrival station (and any stations along the way where they need to change), who escorts them to the barriers at their destination. So, it's not fully independent use, but it is a legal right to turn-up-and-go travel assistance that works well most of the time.  \n\nMy VI friends also use Uber (particularly if they're going somewhere and not meeting someone at the tube station) and generally the drivers are pretty helpful.\n\nSportswise, there is a good VI sports scene but less of the sports you do. Tandem cycling is tricky in London - finding space to store a tandem is hard, London roads are busy with lots of stop-starting and most trains won't take tandems so it's hard to skip the grotty getting-out-of-London bit. There is some indoor provision at the velodrome.   \n\nVI running is very easy - there's an active Achilles International chapter and most parkruns (free, weekly, 5km runs) will help you find a VI guide. I do a bit of VI swim guiding and others either swim with a disability group or go at quiet times and find leisure centre staff happy to help guide them around the centre. One of my friends plays a lot of VI tennis. There's a gang from my VI running group going for a day of VI water skiing, paddle boarding etc in a couple of weeks, but they are travelling out of London. It looks like Metro blind sports have a climbing group: [https://www.metroblindsport.org/about-us/](https://www.metroblindsport.org/about-us/)\n\nThe only thing I will warn you is that a lot of the more fun/adventurous VI sports take place on weekdays during work hours, so your options will be more limited if you have a full-time job with standard working hours. \n\nIf you're on instagram head over to [https://www.instagram.com/achillesinternationaluk/](https://www.instagram.com/achillesinternationaluk/) to see the Achilles group - if you DM them they may be able to chat. This is a podcast from a blind American guy who joined us last year - he came to London specifically to live more independently, but I don't think the city he was in in the US had great public transport options: [https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/taking-off-the-shades](https://feeds.acast.com/public/shows/taking-off-the-shades) Blind people use the tube, especially for regular journeys. If you have a guide dog you may want to stick to stations with lifts and stairs rather than escalators, but if you get to the ticket hall, staff should be able to take you to a train.\n\nAs you've noticed, buses are slow, and Uber costs add up (and can be even slower)\n\nI'd contact the RNIB (the big UK blind charity) for advice on useful apps and guidance - they offer training to help people get used to getting from A to B. I'm not visually impaired, but my work involves people with visual impairments and various disabilities so I'm more aware than some people of accessibility in London. \n\nTransport for London will provide assistance when travelling on the tube for blind passengers, including helping them on the train at their departure station and radioing ahead to ensure they are met at their final station. The tube really varies in its level of accessibility - many stations are old, confusing and with no lift access, but some newer ones (particularly the Elizabeth line) are spacious, easy to navigate and step free. If you pick an area to live based on an accessible station and learn your routes, travelling on the tube could be straight forward for you. Those I work with who have accessibility requirements know their routes well and choose quieter times to travel. \n\nLondon as a city can feel far bigger, more densely populated and overwhelming than somewhere like DC, however it is very walkable and many people walk or cycle everywhere. It also has very clear neighborhoods, which vary massively and can feel like small towns in themselves. If you pick the right neighbourhood, you may find you rarely need public transport and can have a great social life within walking distance. I live in East London and have a kid, so all of my social life is a short walk away. It is also a very green city and has many parks and outdoor spaces. It also has many of the same benefits of DC with lots of free museums and cultural landmarks. I have a friend who as one of their disability benefits receives a certain number of subsidised cab rides a month. I can ask them for the information about the programme if that would be helpful! Lucy Edwards comes to mind as someone on various social media platforms putting out her experience of what it's like living as a legally blind person in South East England. Might be worth checking out her stuff.",

Asking on behalf of my lovely girlfriend.\n\nShe recently just got a new job in Royal Victoria and needs to rejig her schedule a bit. She’s thinking of swimming at Newham Leisure Centre as it’s more or less on her way back home.\n\nShe noticed that quite often, under the Swim for Fitness sessions (it’s a Better leisure centre if that helps) there seems to only be space for 2 people and it’s noted that there is only 1x lane. We’re assuming that this is due to lessons, but we can see on other days and times that those sessions are noted to be shared with lessons. So not entirely sure what’s going on. \n\nHas anyone ever been to those sessions and could you explain what the set up is like? She’s a bit scared that the other swimmer with her might be super fast (or slow) and just kinda mess up her laps. However her office days coincide with the days and times where this seems this set up is the only option. \n\nA bit of a niche question but hopefully someone can help!  How far apart are the slots? In some better centres they are 10min apart so it could be that they are only letting 2 people in per 10min but there would be more than 2 people there\n\nHaven’t swum at Newham but have other Better ones so just wondering if that could be it?

    "chunk_text": "Globe Road / Mile End Road - no accommodation for pedestrians Back in 2014 I wrote to Tower Hamlets ([summarised in this blog post](https://brodiesnotes.blogspot.com/2014/01/crossing-globe-road-near-stepney-green.html)) requesting, unsuccessfully, a pedestrian crossing on Globe Road (B120) next to Stepney Green station. It's a well-used pedestrian route but to get across you have to wait for a break in traffic, or for a bus to go past on Mile End Road (A11) providing cover.\n\nThere are three separate traffic flows\n\n* One route leaving Globe Road with traffic turning left onto Mile End Road\n* Two routes into Globe Road\n   * Traffic from Mile End Road (travelling towards Bow) turns left into Globe Road\n   * Traffic from Mile End Road (from White Horse Lane) turns right into Globe Road\n\nWhile there are traffic lights on Mile End Road controlling the traffic there is never a point where all three traffic flows stop simultaneously to give pedestrians a chance of getting across.\n\nThis seems deranged.\n\nAccidents (traffic v pedestrian) are apparently not that common and I'm not too surprised because there's no obvious time window for pedestrians so they tend to be a bit more cautious (or can just run fast), however I think there are plenty of near-misses and it's not much fun to have cars honking their horns at you if you're on the road where they wan tto be. It's not just about reducing accidents it's about making it easier (or even possible!) for people on foot to cross the road. Of course it's a lot easier for the young and fit, goodness knows how people with mobility problems or visually impaired people manage it (you can walk further down into Globe Road and cross more safely there).\n\nIn 2019 I also submitted a response to a Tower Hamlets consultation ([a different blog post](https://brodiesnotes.blogspot.com/2019/11/support-pedestrians-at-globe-road-mile.html?showComment=1733344286197#c2496529399414056200)) but nothing has changed.\n\nI can see that there was also a [petition in 2018](https://www.london.gov.uk/petitions/mile-end-roadglobe-road-crossing), and more recently a [report to TfL's Streetcare in September 2024](https://streetcare.tfl.gov.uk/report/6494187) \\- the reply to that wrongly says that the \"crossing point has audible tone for pedestrians use\". Annoyingly Google Maps is also mistaken, [showing a pedestrian crossing](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5219088,-0.0462329,20z) where one doesn't exist.\n\nMile End is a Red Route so I can see that TfL is probably reluctant to change things as it will force traffic elsewhere but it does irritate me that drivers are prioritised to this extent over walkers.\n\nAny suggestions (other than arrive via a different route which I mostly do these days!)?  \nThank you :)  \nJo\n\nedited to add 'Road' to the \"Traffic from Mile End\" as the traffic isn't actually coming from Mile End but from Mile End Road. Also added 'or visually impaired people' to \"people with mobility problems\".  It is fucking awful round there.  I don't use Stepney Green station for this very reason.  I tried approaching from the other side of Mile End Road and then crossing over White Horse Lane, to then cross over Mile End Road in front of Stepney Green Station entrance - but this was just less awful.  \n\nI find crossing in the dark to be so bad that I felt unsafe around the station as whole.  You invest so much energy in checking different directions for oncoming traffic and cyclists that you lose track of who is around you after you manage to cross the road.    There should absolutely be a crossing there.  And there should be a camera dishing out tickets to all the BMW dickheads that routinely drive through red lights while people are crossing. Sorry I don’t have any suggestions but just want to say I fully agree with this and often think about contacting Tower Hamlets to request this as well - how frustrating that their response is “not enough accidents yet.” Yeah, actually one of the things I noticed when I moved to the area is how many streets lack any pedestrian crossings at all, and you just have to run praying for your life. That one is particularly egregious because it is used by so many people. \n\nSeen worse, though, literally next to schools and I wonder how we have avoided more accidents. Cross here everyday and there are always people stepping out without realising someone is turning and cars beeping. Accident waiting to happen. According to this (and if I've understood it correctly!) there appears to be a peak of around 50,000 people tapping out at Stepney Green station (there is quite a bit of variation, e.g. 5,000 only on New Year's Eve, average about 35,000).  Let's assume only one quarter turn left to cross Globe Road and that's still around 12,000 visitors trying to cross every day and having to fight with cars. Possibly double that if we count people from the area tapping in to Stephey Green.\n\nScreenshot from TfL's \"Taps by Tube & TfL Rail stations\" page filtered to show only Stepney Green, and only exit taps.\n\n[https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZDgwZWY4NWMtZTFkMi00YzM2LThiMWQtNzg2ZTc2YjliNzM2IiwidCI6IjFmYmQ2NWJmLTVkZWYtNGVlYS1hNjkyLWEwODljMjU1MzQ2YiIsImMiOjh9](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZDgwZWY4NWMtZTFkMi00YzM2LThiMWQtNzg2ZTc2YjliNzM2IiwidCI6IjFmYmQ2NWJmLTVkZWYtNGVlYS1hNjkyLWEwODljMjU1MzQ2YiIsImMiOjh9)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdiyczj7147f1.png?width=2352&format=png&auto=webp&s=789d8f430b6d0a21afced98e57a1bccb9bb232b1",

Nothing came into contact with the packaging box it’s in so in theory it’s fine to handle.\n\nFor the record I do not have any symptoms of anything, it was just a general check up. I’m sorry to society for this oversight. Handling my STI kit should not be someone else’s issue and yet, today, it is.  Guys, I think we found the naked biker. Lucky for you, I picked it up and processsed it.

I lived in London before 1999-2017 (minus 4 years at uni) but I guess I’ve gotten used to living among the rustling trees and relative quiet of the shire. \n\nMy neighbour to the left is a lovely old man, no noise. \n\nTo the right is a family that shout instead of talk, but they’re not on the “living rooms” side (the side the rooms I use most of the day are on) so I can mostly not hear them. \n\n2 doors down on the left is a house that has loud parties in the garden every Saturday. \n\nEvery day a car will drive by with 💩 music blaring. \n\nIs this just normal close quartered big city living? Is life in London just loud? Or am I in a neighbourhood of noisy buggers?\n\nFor context, I’m in a Victorian terrace house in east London zone 2/3 on a residential road set back from the bus routes etc. \n\nI’d love to sit in my garden right now, but it’s not a very peaceful place to be even though it looks it from indoors! I would struggle to meditate in the living room right now too, with noisy neighbours hanging out on the street (again). \n\nDefinitely gonna invest in soundproofing as part of my renovation! Definitely a lot of leafy, quieter areas in the city but they’re not in east London zone 2/3. It depends on the street. When I was trying to find a flat, I made sure there was no pub around and the flat was in a “family neighbourhood”. Also, I made sure that the flat looks at the garden part of the building and not the main road. I've lived here all my life and don't consider it that loud particularly, just sounds of life innit - I went to New York recently and that's a LOUD LOUD city, London seems peaceful in comparison. It's the cars, motorbikes, delivery trucks, and planes descending into Heathrow that do my head in. Would happily trade those for the sounds of kids playing in the street.  I just moved into a new place, apparently one of my neighbours has decided Saturday is community music day, because they play their music so loud I can't hear my TV over it.\n\nBut at least they don't do it during the week or late into the night. My last place was in a large building and people would  play music super loud on random weeknights, and my former flatmate would frequently be in the kitchen at 2am because of his random work schedule.\n\nPeople are just very inconsiderate these days/don't realise how loud they are.",

I am visiting London for a week and was curious if anyone knew of a Chinese restaurant that serves Ma La beef? \n\nI might be calling it by the wrong name. My only experience with this dish was at a restaurant in my home town that stopped serving it 5 years ago. They called it MaLa beef jerky.  It was a cold dish of strips of beef. It was oily, spicy and numbing and amazing. \n\nWith how large London is, I'm hopeful maybe somewhere in this city would have it. The recipe below I  think is pretty similar to the dish I'm looking for, but I really am not sure as I've never tried to make it. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.chinasichuanfood.com/sichuan-mala-beef/#recipe The dish you're looking for is called *fuqi feipian* (*夫妻肺片*). A literal translation is 'husband and wife lung slices'.\n\nThere's a Hunan restaurant on Liverpool Road in Islington called Yipin which has really good Sichuan food, I reckon they'd probably have it.\n\nThere's another one off Brick Lane called Sichuan Folk but it's a good few years since I've been there so not sure how good it is still. I'd be surprised if they didn't have it on the menu.\n\nEdit: Just realised that I didn't read it properly and you're looking for jerky. You'd probably be able to get it in one of the Tian Tian supermarkets in a packet. There is a restaurant near St James’s Park tube station called Ma La Sichuan. I was there last week. They have it, or something very similar. Check out the menu on their website. I'll check those out.  The restaurant in my town called it jerky, but I don't know how accurate that name was. It wasn't a pre packaged thing.  When I ordered it, I was delivered in a take out box and it was room temp or maybe even chilled. It was in the box with oil and all the spices and chilies all mixed together.  It was from the \"cold appetizer\" section of their menu. You might be able to get it one of those restaurants, but I'm not 100% sure what it's called. Try the fuqi feipian, it's cold beef in a chilli and Sichuan pepper sauce.",

So next day I got the app and typed in the reg. it told me I needed to pay congestion charge I was a bit shocked as my partner was under the impression it was exempt. lol. So I went through the payment on the iOS app. And then realised it had today’s day selected. So I paid for the day I didn’t need it for and still had to pay for yesterday.  And there is no way to get a refund. Feel like I paid a fine or something. They make it so difficult. If you could only recover your password easily on the web based interface i wouldn’t have had this trouble. But they are awful with sending receipts and their phone lines are always closed when you need them the most. I feel like they know people are going to pay accidentally and take full advantage of customers. There should be a box or a prompt that confirms that you are agreeing to a non refundable charge and make sure dates are correct so idiots like me don’t make mistakes like this again. \n\nYou got to rights because you are “buying the right to drive” and they give you this right. \nIdk robbing bastards. \nRant over I fink. Idk. Im pissed.  User blames their own lack of understanding of how a thing - that millions of people use without issue every week - works, on someone else. \n\nColour me shocked. \n\nEdit: punctuation.  You don’t need to log in to pay for the tunnel tolls on the TfL website. The login is mainly useful for setting up autopay.\n\nWhy would you think your car is congestion charge exempt? The TfL site doesn't tell you which charges you *need* to pay, it merely lets you know which ones you'd have to pay *if* you happened to drive on any roads for which those charges apply.  So it'll always say that my car needs to pay congestion charge, but that's only because if I drove it through central London then yes, I'd need to pay CC.  If I don't go anywhere near the CC zone however, then no payment is required...\n\nThe only way to know for sure which charges your vehicle has accrued and which you definitely DO therefore need to pay, is to sign up for auto-pay and let that deal with working it all out - any charges accrued will appear on your account 3-4 days later, and you can either then make a one off payment or just wait for the end of the month and let it take a single bundled up payment then.\n\nOtherwise, if you're just making one off payments for each individual charge, you have to know yourself which ones to pay for, and on which days... Skill issue.",

Finally got tickets to the Barbican Conservatory and was just wondering if someone could share some insights on the following: \n\n- when does the Conservatory itself close on the evening? (Their website only shows the closing time for the Barbican Centre (11pm) but not for the Conservatory)\n\n- how long should I expect to spend there? \n\n- any recommended dinner spots that’s not too expensive (<£20pp) around the area? \n\nThanks everyone!! 🤩🤩\n \\> how long should I expect to spend there?\n\nNot nearly as long as you think. There's a bar, but you can take in everything inside in less than 15 minutes. It's not like Kew. I went once for a wedding and absolutely loved it, but when I went for just a drink it was a bit...dull.\n\n\\> any recommended dinner spots that’s not too expensive (<£20pp) around the area?\n\nTake a walk down Whitecross Street. You're looking at a sit down chip shop (Kennedy's, or Gosling's a bit further up and to the west) or a Nando's for that price in the evening. If you can stretch your budget a bit further you can get an excellent meal at Brutto in nearby Smithfield, and the nearby Fox and Anchor (I can't vouch for quality) will do you pub food. I hope you have a great time but I found it underwhelming, especially given its popularity and hype. My recollection is that it's relatively small and you don't spend as much time as you think you would.\n\nIf you like Italian, Brutto is nearby and is very good! Officina 00 also (but just pasta). Manteca and Popolo too, but they're Shoreditch way. All very reasonable price wise.Coq d'argent for french (Bank) Monohon ramen on old street Not sure when it closes, but 30min there should be enough. Also Barbican has a very nice canteen You should probably contact their helpdesk, mate.",

Thanks! its terrifying to me that 80s/90s now constitutes vintage. You might struggle to get both a reasonable range *and* that era. It's an assumption but given you're looking for 80s/90s I'm thinking it's Armani, Boss etc... you're looking for rather than English tailoring? Rokit will always have some bits. Your best bet is maybe Hornets as they have a large range of mens tailoring even if tends more towards traditional styles. Brick lane vintage market might have what you’re looking for. I was recently horrified to see they now stock 90s ‘vintage’ clothing. eBay or vinted is the only viable place as you will be able to put designers name in and \"42r\" if you wanted a 42 regular chest size. You might find a suit in a vintage shop but it will take rooting around a lot of them and it will be 2 sizes too small or the legs will be too short. It's not worth the time and effort. Anywhere with a wide range is fine but yeah like you say often the vintage stuff is more focused on English tailoring or an earlier period like 40s/50s etc",

If possible, reasonably central location. TIA ! :) Genuinely there's loads, but if you want one for today without a booking? Very unlikely in Central.\n\n\nI think better than people listing the numerous places you're probably better off searching \"beer garden roast\" on Google maps and just trying all the results to see if you can book an outside table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally the best roasts aren't in Central, but here's a few decent ones with outside spaces to start you off. Probably all full, and again, not as good as zone 2/3\n\n\nThe Anchor & Hope, The Wilmington, The Audley Public House, The Coach Makers Arms Pub Marylebone, The Royal Oak (Marylebone area), The Grazing Goat Pub & Boutique Hotel Marylebone The Black Horse, Dutchy Arms, and Doghouse in Kennington.  I love the roast at Fallow. They have nice outdoor seating. Not particularly central, but the Alma in Crystal Palace does one of the best pub roasts I've had (especially the pork belly) and has a decent sized beer garden.  Royal Inn on the Park just off Victoria park has an outdoor space and a roast menu, it’s always very busy even throughout winter though",

I'm quite new to plants so can't speak for pricing as I have no reference points but I found it to be acceptable considering the area Rassells Gardening Services - Earls Court Rd If you look for proper value for money and long lasting plants cross the city to Columbia Road flower market.\n\nOtherwise the nursery by world's end is quite good...",

Those ones were from [**Safehaven Initiative CIC**](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16061849) (16061849, incorporated Nov 2024) / [**Safehaven Initiative Union CIC**](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16490068) (16490068, incorporated 2nd June 2025!) and I spoke to one of them who said they were collecting donations and not selling magazines or anything. \n\nThey aren't registered with the Fundraising Regulator (to be fair, they don't have to be, that's voluntary) but I think they do need to have a collection permit from either Islington Council or Metropolitan Police. The automated response I got from Met Police was inexplicable so I'll follow that up next week. \n\nI've mostly seen 'Uplifterz' ([**Uplifterz CIC**](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15835071) 15835071 and [**Uplifterz Union C.I.C.**](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/15944885) 15944885) selling their magazine in the past at Farringdon; found them really quite persistent ([as did someone on Mumsnet](https://www.mumsnet.com/talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/5198440-to-feel-a-bit-harassed-by-charity-worker)). \n\nI'm not sure if / how Uplifterz intersect with other 'chugger' companies like **Atoma C.I.C.** (the company was dissolved but there was a court-ordered restoration and according to their own website they are now changing to **Youth Works Union**). There's an [Alamy photograph purportedly of Youth Works Union selling an Uplifterz magazine](https://www.alamy.com/face-to-face-fundraising-chuggers-street-fundraising-charity-workers-for-youth-works-union-selling-uplifterz-magazines-to-the-public-on-london-bridge-london-uk-image656571120.html) but I can't confirm if that's what's depicted (they've also mislabelled them as a charity)\n\n[All the ones I've heard about are listed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1l0k936/train_station_chuggers_selling_magazines_or/), I'm keeping it updated as I hear of more ;) There's also a separate r/werblighty subreddit for the homeless veteran CIC (whose accounts are due at the end of this month).\n\nJo They've started doing a fake \"oh miss you dropped something\" a lot. I watched them do it to someone and then was prepared to keep moving when they did it to me. I’ve had “you look friendly” as an opener.\n\nI replied “fuck off”\n\nNo regrets.",

Off the top of my head I don’t think there are any that do that sort of thing. If you can get hold of StickerBomb books from somewhere like Waterstones or Foyles they contain that sort of thing but I don’t know how easy they are to get as I’ve had mine for years.\nFailing that you could always try somewhere like [Teepublic](https://www.teepublic.com) which is full of independent artists selling their wares on T-shirts and stickers etc, admittedly there are also a bunch of arseholes on there who rip off other peoples designs and try and pass them off as their own (it’s happened to me so I don’t tend to advertise my store much now) but the quality is pretty good.\nAlso you can get 20% off your first order with Teepublic. if you search for etsy london based shops you could probably pick them up form the seller locally... just go onto etsy... there are literally thousands of stickers for sale (including mine)\n\n[https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=stickers&ref=search\\_bar](https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=stickers&ref=search_bar) This feels like the winner!

Have you spoken to organisations/charities that provide similar services? Are you working StreetLink or any of the organizations and charities that work with homeless? This is a vulnerable group of people, it's really going to help you do your research if you give a bit of background on who you are and who you're designing this accomodation for - especially with a new reddit account and this being your only post. Is this a uni/college project or is it a live project?",

Not sure if she still shoots or not,, maybe an OF, but love her, an a natural beauty that can totally get down That last image isn't a smile 🤣 I love that in every shot she smiles, whether they treat her well or not, she smiles. For sure. She's definitely way up higher on my personal list than either of them. I was never big on either, I get it with both, but I would take Layla in a second I would have liked to have seen more than one anal in her.",

Been my #1 since that day. Just wish she stayed in the industry longer. But the scenes she gave us never get old even 8 years later.\n\nShe’s my favorite of all time 🔥 Look at them fucking titties... God damn. Nipple so proportional with the tit. She’s so pretty. I think THIS is the scene that turned me on girls lol Same. Saw her here and I was like man she should do more.
